I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also. 01:024:047 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands. 01:024:048 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son. 01:024:049 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. 01:024:050 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. 01:024:051 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken. 01:024:052 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth. 01:024:053 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. 01:024:054 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. 01:024:055 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go. 01:024:056 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master. 01:024:057 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. 01:024:058 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go. 01:024:059 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. 01:024:060 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them. 01:024:061 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. 01:024:062 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country. 01:024:063 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming. 01:024:064 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. 01:024:065 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself. 01:024:066 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. 01:024:067 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death. 01:025:001 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. 01:025:002 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. 01:025:003 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 01:025:004 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 01:025:005 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 01:025:006 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. 01:025:007 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. 01:025:008 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. 01:025:009 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; 01:025:010 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 01:025:011 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi. 01:025:012 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 01:025:013 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 01:025:014 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, 01:025:015 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 01:025:016 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations. 01:025:017 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. 01:025:018 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren. 01:025:019 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac: 01:025:020 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. 01:025:021 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 01:025:022 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD. 01:025:023 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger. 01:025:024 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 01:025:025 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. 01:025:026 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them. 01:025:027 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. 01:025:028 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. 01:025:029 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint: 01:025:030 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom. 01:025:031 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. 01:025:032 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? 01:025:033 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 01:025:034 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright. 01:026:001 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 01:026:002 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 01:026:003 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 01:026:004 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; 01:026:005 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. 01:026:006 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 01:026:007 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon. 01:026:008 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. 01:026:009 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. 01:026:010 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. 01:026:011 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. 01:026:012 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. 01:026:013 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: 01:026:014 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him. 01:026:015 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. 01:026:016 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. 01:026:017 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 01:026:018 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. 01:026:019 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. 01:026:020 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. 01:026:021 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. 01:026:022 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. 01:026:023 And he went up from thence to Beersheba. 01:026:024 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake. 01:026:025 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well. 01:026:026 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 01:026:027 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? 01:026:028 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; 01:026:029 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD. 01:026:030 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 01:026:031 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 01:026:032 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. 01:026:033 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day. 01:026:034 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: 01:026:035 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah. 01:027:001 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I. 01:027:002 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death: 01:027:003 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 01:027:004 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die. 01:027:005 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. 01:027:006 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 01:027:007 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death. 01:027:008 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee. 01:027:009 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth: 01:027:010 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death. 01:027:011 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 01:027:012 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing. 01:027:013 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them. 01:027:014 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. 01:027:015 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son: 01:027:016 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck: 01:027:017 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. 01:027:018 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son? 01:027:019 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. 01:027:020 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me. 01:027:021 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not. 01:027:022 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 01:027:023 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him. 01:027:024 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. 01:027:025 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank. 01:027:026 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son. 01:027:027 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 01:027:028 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: 01:027:029 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee. 01:027:030 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 01:027:031 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me. 01:027:032 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau. 01:027:033 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed. 01:027:034 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father. 01:027:035 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing. 01:027:036 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? 01:027:037 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son? 01:027:038 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 01:027:039 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above; 01:027:040 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck. 01:027:041 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob. 01:027:042 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee. 01:027:043 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; 01:027:044 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away; 01:027:045 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day? 01:027:046 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me? 01:028:001 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 01:028:002 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy mother's brother. 01:028:003 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 01:028:004 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. 01:028:005 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother. 01:028:006 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canaan; 01:028:007 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram; 01:028:008 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; 01:028:009 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife. 01:028:010 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. 01:028:011 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. 01:028:012 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 01:028:013 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; 01:028:014 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. 01:028:015 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. 01:028:016 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not. 01:028:017 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. 01:028:018 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. 01:028:019 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was called Luz at the first. 01:028:020 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, 01:028:021 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God: 01:028:022 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee. 01:029:001 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east. 01:029:002 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's mouth. 01:029:003 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place. 01:029:004 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we. 01:029:005 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. 01:029:006 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep. 01:029:007 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them. 01:029:008 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep. 01:029:009 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them. 01:029:010 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. 01:029:011 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 01:029:012 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father. 01:029:013 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. 01:029:014 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. 01:029:015 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be? 01:029:016 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 01:029:017 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. 01:029:018 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. 01:029:019 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me. 01:029:020 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her. 01:029:021 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. 01:029:022 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. 01:029:023 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. 01:029:024 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid. 01:029:025 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? 01:029:026 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. 01:029:027 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. 01:029:028 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also. 01:029:029 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid. 01:029:030 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. 01:029:031 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren. 01:029:032 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me. 01:029:033 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon. 01:029:034 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi. 01:029:035 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing. 01:030:001 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. 01:030:002 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb? 01:030:003 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her. 01:030:004 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her. 01:030:005 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. 01:030:006 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan. 01:030:007 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. 01:030:008 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali. 01:030:009 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. 01:030:010 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son. 01:030:011 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad. 01:030:012 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son. 01:030:013 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher. 01:030:014 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. 01:030:015 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes. 01:030:016 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. 01:030:017 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son. 01:030:018 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar. 01:030:019 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son. 01:030:020 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun. 01:030:021 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah. 01:030:022 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. 01:030:023 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach: 01:030:024 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son. 01:030:025 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country. 01:030:026 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee. 01:030:027 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake. 01:030:028 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it. 01:030:029 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me. 01:030:030 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also? 01:030:031 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock. 01:030:032 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire. 01:030:033 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me. 01:030:034 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word. 01:030:035 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. 01:030:036 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks. 01:030:037 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. 01:030:038 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink. 01:030:039 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. 01:030:040 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle. 01:030:041 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. 01:030:042 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. 01:030:043 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses. 01:031:001 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory. 01:031:002 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before. 01:031:003 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. 01:031:004 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, 01:031:005 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me. 01:031:006 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. 01:031:007 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me. 01:031:008 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked. 01:031:009 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me. 01:031:010 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled. 01:031:011 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I. 01:031:012 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. 01:031:013 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred. 01:031:014 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? 01:031:015 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money. 01:031:016 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do. 01:031:017 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; 01:031:018 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. 01:031:019 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's. 01:031:020 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled. 01:031:021 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead. 01:031:022 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. 01:031:023 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead. 01:031:024 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 01:031:025 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. 01:031:026 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword? 01:031:027 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? 01:031:028 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing. 01:031:029 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 01:031:030 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? 01:031:031 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. 01:031:032 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. 01:031:033 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. 01:031:034 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not. 01:031:035 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images. 01:031:036 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? 01:031:037 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both. 01:031:038 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. 01:031:039 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. 01:031:040 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. 01:031:041 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times. 01:031:042 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight. 01:031:043 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born? 01:031:044 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee. 01:031:045 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. 01:031:046 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. 01:031:047 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. 01:031:048 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 01:031:049 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. 01:031:050 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee. 01:031:051 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee: 01:031:052 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. 01:031:053 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac. 01:031:054 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount. 01:031:055 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place. 01:032:001 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 01:032:002 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. 01:032:003 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 01:032:004 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: 01:032:005 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight. 01:032:006 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. 01:032:007 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; 01:032:008 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape. 01:032:009 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 01:032:010 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. 01:032:011 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children. 01:032:012 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. 01:032:013 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; 01:032:014 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 01:032:015 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. 01:032:016 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. 01:032:017 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? 01:032:018 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us. 01:032:019 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. 01:032:020 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. 01:032:021 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. 01:032:022 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. 01:032:023 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. 01:032:024 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. 01:032:025 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. 01:032:026 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. 01:032:027 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. 01:032:028 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. 01:032:029 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. 01:032:030 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. 01:032:031 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. 01:032:032 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank. 01:033:001 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 01:033:002 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 01:033:003 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. 01:033:004 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept. 01:033:005 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. 01:033:006 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. 01:033:007 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. 01:033:008 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord. 01:033:009 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself. 01:033:010 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me. 01:033:011 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it. 01:033:012 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee. 01:033:013 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die. 01:033:014 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. 01:033:015 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. 01:033:016 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. 01:033:017 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. 01:033:018 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city. 01:033:019 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. 01:033:020 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael. 01:034:001 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 01:034:002 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her. 01:034:003 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. 01:034:004 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. 01:034:005 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come. 01:034:006 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him. 01:034:007 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done. 01:034:008 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. 01:034:009 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. 01:034:010 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. 01:034:011 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. 01:034:012 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. 01:034:013 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: 01:034:014 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us: 01:034:015 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised; 01:034:016 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. 01:034:017 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone. 01:034:018 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. 01:034:019 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father. 01:034:020 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, 01:034:021 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. 01:034:022 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. 01:034:023 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us. 01:034:024 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city. 01:034:025 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males. 01:034:026 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out. 01:034:027 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. 01:034:028 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, 01:034:029 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house. 01:034:030 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house. 01:034:031 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot? 01:035:001 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. 01:035:002 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments: 01:035:003 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. 01:035:004 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. 01:035:005 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 01:035:006 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him. 01:035:007 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 01:035:008 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth. 01:035:009 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him. 01:035:010 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. 01:035:011 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; 01:035:012 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. 01:035:013 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. 01:035:014 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. 01:035:015 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel. 01:035:016 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. 01:035:017 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. 01:035:018 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin. 01:035:019 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. 01:035:020 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day. 01:035:021 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar. 01:035:022 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 01:035:023 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun: 01:035:024 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 01:035:025 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 01:035:026 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram. 01:035:027 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. 01:035:028 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years. 01:035:029 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. 01:036:001 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom. 01:036:002 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 01:036:003 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. 01:036:004 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 01:036:005 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan. 01:036:006 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. 01:036:007 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle. 01:036:008 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom. 01:036:009 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir: 01:036:010 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau. 01:036:011 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. 01:036:012 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife. 01:036:013 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife. 01:036:014 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah. 01:036:015 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz, 01:036:016 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah. 01:036:017 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife. 01:036:018 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife. 01:036:019 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes. 01:036:020 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, 01:036:021 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom. 01:036:022 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna. 01:036:023 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 01:036:024 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father. 01:036:025 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah. 01:036:026 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran. 01:036:027 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan. 01:036:028 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran. 01:036:029 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah, 01:036:030 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir. 01:036:031 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel. 01:036:032 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 01:036:033 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. 01:036:034 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead. 01:036:035 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith. 01:036:036 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. 01:036:037 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead. 01:036:038 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. 01:036:039 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab. 01:036:040 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, 01:036:041 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon, 01:036:042 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 01:036:043 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the father of the Edomites. 01:037:001 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. 01:037:002 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report. 01:037:003 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours. 01:037:004 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. 01:037:005 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. 01:037:006 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: 01:037:007 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. 01:037:008 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. 01:037:009 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. 01:037:010 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? 01:037:011 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. 01:037:012 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. 01:037:013 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. 01:037:014 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 01:037:015 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? 01:037:016 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks. 01:037:017 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. 01:037:018 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. 01:037:019 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. 01:037:020 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. 01:037:021 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him. 01:037:022 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again. 01:037:023 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him; 01:037:024 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. 01:037:025 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt. 01:037:026 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? 01:037:027 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content. 01:037:028 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. 01:037:029 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. 01:037:030 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go? 01:037:031 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 01:037:032 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no. 01:037:033 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces. 01:037:034 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. 01:037:035 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him. 01:037:036 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard. 01:038:001 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah. 01:038:002 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her. 01:038:003 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er. 01:038:004 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan. 01:038:005 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. 01:038:006 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar. 01:038:007 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him. 01:038:008 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. 01:038:009 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. 01:038:010 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also. 01:038:011 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house. 01:038:012 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 01:038:013 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep. 01:038:014 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife. 01:038:015 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face. 01:038:016 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? 01:038:017 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it? 01:038:018 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. 01:038:019 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. 01:038:020 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not. 01:038:021 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place. 01:038:022 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place. 01:038:023 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. 01:038:024 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. 01:038:025 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff. 01:038:026 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more. 01:038:027 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb. 01:038:028 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. 01:038:029 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez. 01:038:030 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah. 01:039:001 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. 01:039:002 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 01:039:003 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. 01:039:004 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. 01:039:005 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. 01:039:006 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured. 01:039:007 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. 01:039:008 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; 01:039:009 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? 01:039:010 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. 01:039:011 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within. 01:039:012 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. 01:039:013 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, 01:039:014 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: 01:039:015 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out. 01:039:016 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home. 01:039:017 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: 01:039:018 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out. 01:039:019 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. 01:039:020 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison. 01:039:021 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison. 01:039:022 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. 01:039:023 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper. 01:040:001 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt. 01:040:002 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers. 01:040:003 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. 01:040:004 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward. 01:040:005 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison. 01:040:006 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad. 01:040:007 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day? 01:040:008 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you. 01:040:009 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 01:040:010 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 01:040:011 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. 01:040:012 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days: 01:040:013 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. 01:040:014 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: 01:040:015 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. 01:040:016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head: 01:040:017 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. 01:040:018 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days: 01:040:019 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee. 01:040:020 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. 01:040:021 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 01:040:022 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. 01:040:023 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him. 01:041:001 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. 01:041:002 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 01:041:003 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. 01:041:004 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 01:041:005 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. 01:041:006 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. 01:041:007 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. 01:041:008 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. 01:041:009 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: 01:041:010 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker: 01:041:011 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. 01:041:012 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. 01:041:013 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged. 01:041:014 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 01:041:015 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. 01:041:016 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 01:041:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: 01:041:018 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 01:041:019 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: 01:041:020 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 01:041:021 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. 01:041:022 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: 01:041:023 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 01:041:024 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me. 01:041:025 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. 01:041:026 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. 01:041:027 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. 01:041:028 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. 01:041:029 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: 01:041:030 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; 01:041:031 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous. 01:041:032 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. 01:041:033 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 01:041:034 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. 01:041:035 And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. 01:041:036 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. 01:041:037 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. 01:041:038 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? 01:041:039 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: 01:041:040 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. 01:041:041 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. 01:041:042 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; 01:041:043 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt. 01:041:044 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. 01:041:045 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt. 01:041:046 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 01:041:047 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 01:041:048 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. 01:041:049 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number. 01:041:050 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. 01:041:051 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. 01:041:052 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. 01:041:053 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. 01:041:054 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 01:041:055 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 01:041:056 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. 01:041:057 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands. 01:042:001 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? 01:042:002 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die. 01:042:003 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. 01:042:004 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. 01:042:005 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 01:042:006 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth. 01:042:007 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. 01:042:008 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. 01:042:009 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 01:042:010 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. 01:042:011 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. 01:042:012 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 01:042:013 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. 01:042:014 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies: 01:042:015 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence,
