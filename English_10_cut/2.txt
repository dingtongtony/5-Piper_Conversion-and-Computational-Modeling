except your youngest brother come hither. 01:042:016 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. 01:042:017 And he put them all together into ward three days. 01:042:018 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God: 01:042:019 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: 01:042:020 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. 01:042:021 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. 01:042:022 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. 01:042:023 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter. 01:042:024 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. 01:042:025 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. 01:042:026 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. 01:042:027 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth. 01:042:028 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us? 01:042:029 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, 01:042:030 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country. 01:042:031 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 01:042:032 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. 01:042:033 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: 01:042:034 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. 01:042:035 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. 01:042:036 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me. 01:042:037 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. 01:042:038 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 01:043:001 And the famine was sore in the land. 01:043:002 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. 01:043:003 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. 01:043:004 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food: 01:043:005 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. 01:043:006 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? 01:043:007 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down? 01:043:008 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. 01:043:009 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: 01:043:010 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time. 01:043:011 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: 01:043:012 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 01:043:013 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 01:043:014 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved. 01:043:015 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. 01:043:016 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon. 01:043:017 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. 01:043:018 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. 01:043:019 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, 01:043:020 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: 01:043:021 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. 01:043:022 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. 01:043:023 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. 01:043:024 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. 01:043:025 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there. 01:043:026 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. 01:043:027 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? 01:043:028 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance. 01:043:029 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. 01:043:030 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. 01:043:031 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. 01:043:032 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians. 01:043:033 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. 01:043:034 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And they drank, and were merry with him. 01:044:001 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. 01:044:002 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 01:044:003 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. 01:044:004 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? 01:044:005 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. 01:044:006 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. 01:044:007 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 01:044:008 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? 01:044:009 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. 01:044:010 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. 01:044:011 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. 01:044:012 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. 01:044:013 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. 01:044:014 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. 01:044:015 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? 01:044:016 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found. 01:044:017 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. 01:044:018 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. 01:044:019 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? 01:044:020 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. 01:044:021 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. 01:044:022 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die. 01:044:023 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. 01:044:024 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 01:044:025 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food. 01:044:026 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us. 01:044:027 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons: 01:044:028 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 01:044:029 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 01:044:030 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life; 01:044:031 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. 01:044:032 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. 01:044:033 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. 01:044:034 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father. 01:045:001 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. 01:045:002 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. 01:045:003 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence. 01:045:004 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. 01:045:005 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. 01:045:006 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest. 01:045:007 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. 01:045:008 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. 01:045:009 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: 01:045:010 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 01:045:011 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty. 01:045:012 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. 01:045:013 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. 01:045:014 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 01:045:015 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him. 01:045:016 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. 01:045:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 01:045:018 And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. 01:045:019 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. 01:045:020 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is your's. 01:045:021 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. 01:045:022 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment. 01:045:023 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way. 01:045:024 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way. 01:045:025 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father, 01:045:026 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not. 01:045:027 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 01:045:028 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die. 01:046:001 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. 01:046:002 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I. 01:046:003 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 01:046:004 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. 01:046:005 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 01:046:006 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: 01:046:007 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt. 01:046:008 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. 01:046:009 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. 01:046:010 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. 01:046:011 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 01:046:012 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul. 01:046:013 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron. 01:046:014 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. 01:046:015 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three. 01:046:016 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. 01:046:017 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel. 01:046:018 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls. 01:046:019 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin. 01:046:020 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. 01:046:021 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. 01:046:022 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. 01:046:023 And the sons of Dan; Hushim. 01:046:024 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. 01:046:025 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven. 01:046:026 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six; 01:046:027 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten. 01:046:028 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 01:046:029 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 01:046:030 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive. 01:046:031 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; 01:046:032 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. 01:046:033 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation? 01:046:034 That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians. 01:047:001 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen. 01:047:002 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. 01:047:003 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our fathers. 01:047:004 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen. 01:047:005 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: 01:047:006 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle. 01:047:007 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 01:047:008 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou? 01:047:009 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. 01:047:010 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh. 01:047:011 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 01:047:012 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families. 01:047:013 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. 01:047:014 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 01:047:015 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth. 01:047:016 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail. 01:047:017 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year. 01:047:018 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands: 01:047:019 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate. 01:047:020 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's. 01:047:021 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof. 01:047:022 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands. 01:047:023 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. 01:047:024 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones. 01:047:025 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants. 01:047:026 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's. 01:047:027 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly. 01:047:028 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years. 01:047:029 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 01:047:030 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said. 01:047:031 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head. 01:048:001 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 01:048:002 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. 01:048:003 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 01:048:004 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession. 01:048:005 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. 01:048:006 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. 01:048:007 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem. 01:048:008 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? 01:048:009 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. 01:048:010 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. 01:048:011 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed. 01:048:012 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 01:048:013 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. 01:048:014 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn. 01:048:015 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, 01:048:016 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. 01:048:017 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. 01:048:018 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. 01:048:019 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations. 01:048:020 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. 01:048:021 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. 01:048:022 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow. 01:049:001 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days. 01:049:002 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father. 01:049:003 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 01:049:004 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch. 01:049:005 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations. 01:049:006 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall. 01:049:007 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel. 01:049:008 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee. 01:049:009 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? 01:049:010 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. 01:049:011 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes: 01:049:012 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk. 01:049:013 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon. 01:049:014 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens: 01:049:015 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute. 01:049:016 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel. 01:049:017 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. 01:049:018 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD. 01:049:019 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last. 01:049:020 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties. 01:049:021 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words. 01:049:022 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall: 01:049:023 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him: 01:049:024 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:) 01:049:025 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb: 01:049:026 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren. 01:049:027 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil. 01:049:028 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them. 01:049:029 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 01:049:030 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace. 01:049:031 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. 01:049:032 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth. 01:049:033 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people. 01:050:001 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him. 01:050:002 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. 01:050:003 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days. 01:050:004 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 01:050:005 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again. 01:050:006 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear. 01:050:007 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 01:050:008 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. 01:050:009 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company. 01:050:010 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 01:050:011 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan. 01:050:012 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 01:050:013 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. 01:050:014 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. 01:050:015 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him. 01:050:016 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, 01:050:017 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. 01:050:018 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. 01:050:019 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? 01:050:020 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. 01:050:021 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them. 01:050:022 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. 01:050:023 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees. 01:050:024 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 01:050:025 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. 01:050:026 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt. Book 02 Exodus 02:001:001 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. 02:001:002 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 02:001:003 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 02:001:004 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 02:001:005 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already. 02:001:006 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. 02:001:007 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them. 02:001:008 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. 02:001:009 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we: 02:001:010 Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land. 02:001:011 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. 02:001:012 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. 02:001:013 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: 02:001:014 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour. 02:001:015 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 02:001:016 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live. 02:001:017 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive. 02:001:018 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? 02:001:019 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. 02:001:020 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. 02:001:021 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. 02:001:022 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive. 02:002:001 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi. 02:002:002 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. 02:002:003 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink. 02:002:004 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him. 02:002:005 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. 02:002:006 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. 02:002:007 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? 02:002:008 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. 02:002:009 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it. 02:002:010 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. 02:002:011 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. 02:002:012 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 02:002:013 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? 02:002:014 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. 02:002:015 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. 02:002:016 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. 02:002:017 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 02:002:018 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day? 02:002:019 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. 02:002:020 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. 02:002:021 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. 02:002:022 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. 02:002:023 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. 02:002:024 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 02:002:025 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them. 02:003:001 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. 02:003:002 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. 02:003:003 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. 02:003:004 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. 02:003:005 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 02:003:006 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. 02:003:007 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 02:003:008 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 02:003:009 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. 02:003:010 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. 02:003:011 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? 02:003:012 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. 02:003:013 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? 02:003:014 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. 02:003:015 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. 02:003:016 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: 02:003:017 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. 02:003:018 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God. 02:003:019 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. 02:003:020 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. 02:003:021 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty. 02:003:022 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians. 02:004:001 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee. 02:004:002 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod. 02:004:003 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. 02:004:004 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: 02:004:005 That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee. 02:004:006 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow. 02:004:007 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. 02:004:008 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 02:004:009 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land. 02:004:010 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. 02:004:011 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD? 02:004:012 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. 02:004:013 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. 02:004:014 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. 02:004:015 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. 02:004:016 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God. 02:004:017 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs. 02:004:018 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. 02:004:019 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life. 02:004:020 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. 02:004:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. 02:004:022 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn: 02:004:023 And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn. 02:004:024 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him. 02:004:025 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me. 02:004:026 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision. 02:004:027 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. 02:004:028 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. 02:004:029 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: 02:004:030 And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. 02:004:031 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped. 02:005:001 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. 02:005:002 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go. 02:005:003 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. 02:005:004 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. 02:005:005 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. 02:005:006 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, 02:005:007 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. 02:005:008 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. 02:005:009 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words. 02:005:010 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. 02:005:011 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished. 02:005:012 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. 02:005:013 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw. 02:005:014 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? 02:005:015 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? 02:005:016 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people. 02:005:017 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD. 02:005:018 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. 02:005:019 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task. 02:005:020 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 02:005:021 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. 02:005:022 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? 02:005:023 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all. 02:006:001 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. 02:006:002 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: 02:006:003 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. 02:006:004 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. 02:006:005 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. 02:006:006 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: 02:006:007 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 02:006:008 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD. 02:006:009 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. 02:006:010 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 02:006:011 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. 02:006:012 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? 02:006:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. 02:006:014 These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben. 02:006:015 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon. 02:006:016 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years. 02:006:017 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families. 02:006:018 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years. 02:006:019 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations. 02:006:020 And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years. 02:006:021 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 02:006:022 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri. 02:006:023 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 02:006:024 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites. 02:006:025 And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families. 02:006:026 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies. 02:006:027 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron. 02:006:028 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, 02:006:029 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee. 02:006:030 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me? 02:007:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. 02:007:002 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land. 02:007:003 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 02:007:004 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. 02:007:005 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them. 02:007:006 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they. 02:007:007 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh. 02:007:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 02:007:009 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent. 02:007:010 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 02:007:011 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. 02:007:012 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. 02:007:013 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. 02:007:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go. 02:007:015 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. 02:007:016 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear. 02:007:017 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. 02:007:018 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river. 02:007:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone. 02:007:020 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. 02:007:021 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. 02:007:022 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said. 02:007:023 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also. 02:007:024 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. 02:007:025 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river. 02:008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 02:008:002 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: 02:008:003 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs: 02:008:004 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants. 02:008:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. 02:008:006 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 02:008:007 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. 02:008:008 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD. 02:008:009 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only? 02:008:010 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God. 02:008:011 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only. 02:008:012 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh. 02:008:013 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields. 02:008:014 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank. 02:008:015 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. 02:008:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 02:008:017 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 02:008:018 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast. 02:008:019 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. 02:008:020 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 02:008:021 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are. 02:008:022 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. 02:008:023 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be. 02:008:024 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies. 02:008:025 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. 02:008:026 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? 02:008:027 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us. 02:008:028 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me. 02:008:029 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. 02:008:030 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 02:008:031 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. 02:008:032 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go. 02:009:001 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 02:009:002 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 02:009:003 Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain. 02:009:004 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel. 02:009:005 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land. 02:009:006 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. 02:009:007 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. 02:009:008 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. 02:009:009 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. 02:009:010 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast. 02:009:011 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. 02:009:012 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses. 02:009:013 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 02:009:014 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth. 02:009:015 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. 02:009:016 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. 02:009:017 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go? 02:009:018 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now. 02:009:019 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die. 02:009:020 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 02:009:021 And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field. 02:009:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. 02:009:023 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt. 02:009:024 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 02:009:025 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field. 02:009:026 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail. 02:009:027 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. 02:009:028 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. 02:009:029 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's. 02:009:030 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God. 02:009:031 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled. 02:009:032 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up. 02:009:033 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth. 02:009:034 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 02:009:035 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses. 02:010:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him: 02:010:002 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD. 02:010:003 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me. 02:010:004 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast: 02:010:005 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field: 02:010:006 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. 02:010:007 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed? 02:010:008 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go? 02:010:009 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD. 02:010:010 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you. 02:010:011 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence. 02:010:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left. 02:010:013 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 02:010:014 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. 02:010:015 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt. 02:010:016 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. 02:010:017 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only. 02:010:018 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 02:010:019 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt. 02:010:020 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go. 02:010:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt. 02:010:022 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 02:010:023 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. 02:010:024 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you. 02:010:025 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God. 02:010:026 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither. 02:010:027 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go. 02:010:028 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die. 02:010:029 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more. 02:011:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. 02:011:002 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and jewels of gold. 02:011:003 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people. 02:011:004 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: 02:011:005 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts. 02:011:006 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more. 02:011:007 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. 02:011:008 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. 02:011:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. 02:011:010 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land. 02:012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying, 02:012:002 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you. 02:012:003 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: 02:012:004 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. 02:012:005 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: 02:012:006 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. 02:012:007 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. 02:012:008 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. 02:012:009 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof. 02:012:010 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. 02:012:011 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover. 02:012:012 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD. 02:012:013 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. 02:012:014 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. 02:012:015 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. 02:012:016 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you. 02:012:017 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever. 02:012:018 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. 02:012:019 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land. 02:012:020 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread. 02:012:021 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover. 02:012:022 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the
