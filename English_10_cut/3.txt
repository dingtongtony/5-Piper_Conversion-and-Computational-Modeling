bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning. 02:012:023 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you. 02:012:024 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. 02:012:025 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. 02:012:026 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? 02:012:027 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. 02:012:028 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. 02:012:029 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle. 02:012:030 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead. 02:012:031 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. 02:012:032 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also. 02:012:033 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men. 02:012:034 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. 02:012:035 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: 02:012:036 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians. 02:012:037 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. 02:012:038 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle. 02:012:039 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual. 02:012:040 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. 02:012:041 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt. 02:012:042 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations. 02:012:043 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 02:012:044 But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. 02:012:045 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof. 02:012:046 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. 02:012:047 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 02:012:048 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. 02:012:049 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you. 02:012:050 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. 02:012:051 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. 02:013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 02:013:002 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine. 02:013:003 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten. 02:013:004 This day came ye out in the month Abib. 02:013:005 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month. 02:013:006 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD. 02:013:007 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters. 02:013:008 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. 02:013:009 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt. 02:013:010 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year. 02:013:011 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee, 02:013:012 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the LORD's. 02:013:013 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem. 02:013:014 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: 02:013:015 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem. 02:013:016 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt. 02:013:017 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 02:013:018 But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt. 02:013:019 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you. 02:013:020 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 02:013:021 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: 02:013:022 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people. 02:014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 02:014:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. 02:014:003 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. 02:014:004 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so. 02:014:005 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? 02:014:006 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: 02:014:007 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. 02:014:008 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand. 02:014:009 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon. 02:014:010 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD. 02:014:011 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? 02:014:012 Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. 02:014:013 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. 02:014:014 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. 02:014:015 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 02:014:016 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. 02:014:017 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 02:014:018 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 02:014:019 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: 02:014:020 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night. 02:014:021 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. 02:014:022 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 02:014:023 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 02:014:024 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 02:014:025 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians. 02:014:026 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. 02:014:027 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 02:014:028 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. 02:014:029 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 02:014:030 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. 02:014:031 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses. 02:015:001 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 02:015:002 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him. 02:015:003 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name. 02:015:004 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea. 02:015:005 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone. 02:015:006 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. 02:015:007 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble. 02:015:008 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea. 02:015:009 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. 02:015:010 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters. 02:015:011 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? 02:015:012 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. 02:015:013 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. 02:015:014 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. 02:015:015 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. 02:015:016 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased. 02:015:017 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have established. 02:015:018 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever. 02:015:019 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. 02:015:020 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. 02:015:021 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 02:015:022 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. 02:015:023 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. 02:015:024 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? 02:015:025 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, 02:015:026 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee. 02:015:027 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters. 02:016:001 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 02:016:002 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 02:016:003 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger. 02:016:004 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no. 02:016:005 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. 02:016:006 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt: 02:016:007 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us? 02:016:008 And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD. 02:016:009 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings. 02:016:010 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. 02:016:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 02:016:012 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God. 02:016:013 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. 02:016:014 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. 02:016:015 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. 02:016:016 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents. 02:016:017 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. 02:016:018 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. 02:016:019 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. 02:016:020 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them. 02:016:021 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. 02:016:022 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 02:016:023 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. 02:016:024 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. 02:016:025 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field. 02:016:026 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none. 02:016:027 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. 02:016:028 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? 02:016:029 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. 02:016:030 So the people rested on the seventh day. 02:016:031 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. 02:016:032 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. 02:016:033 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. 02:016:034 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. 02:016:035 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. 02:016:036 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah. 02:017:001 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink. 02:017:002 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD? 02:017:003 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? 02:017:004 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me. 02:017:005 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go. 02:017:006 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 02:017:007 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not? 02:017:008 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 02:017:009 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand. 02:017:010 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 02:017:011 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. 02:017:012 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 02:017:013 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 02:017:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. 02:017:015 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi: 02:017:016 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation. 02:018:001 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 02:018:002 Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back, 02:018:003 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 02:018:004 And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: 02:018:005 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 02:018:006 And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her. 02:018:007 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent. 02:018:008 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them. 02:018:009 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. 02:018:010 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 02:018:011 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them. 02:018:012 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God. 02:018:013 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. 02:018:014 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even? 02:018:015 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God: 02:018:016 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws. 02:018:017 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good. 02:018:018 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. 02:018:019 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God: 02:018:020 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. 02:018:021 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: 02:018:022 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee. 02:018:023 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace. 02:018:024 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said. 02:018:025 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 02:018:026 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 02:018:027 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land. 02:019:001 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai. 02:019:002 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. 02:019:003 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; 02:019:004 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. 02:019:005 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: 02:019:006 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. 02:019:007 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him. 02:019:008 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. 02:019:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD. 02:019:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 02:019:011 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. 02:019:012 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: 02:019:013 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. 02:019:014 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. 02:019:015 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives. 02:019:016 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. 02:019:017 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 02:019:018 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 02:019:019 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. 02:019:020 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. 02:019:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. 02:019:022 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. 02:019:023 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. 02:019:024 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. 02:019:025 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them. 02:020:001 And God spake all these words, saying, 02:020:002 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 02:020:003 Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 02:020:004 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 02:020:005 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; 02:020:006 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. 02:020:007 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 02:020:008 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 02:020:009 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 02:020:010 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: 02:020:011 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. 02:020:012 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 02:020:013 Thou shalt not kill. 02:020:014 Thou shalt not commit adultery. 02:020:015 Thou shalt not steal. 02:020:016 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 02:020:017 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's. 02:020:018 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off. 02:020:019 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die. 02:020:020 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. 02:020:021 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was. 02:020:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. 02:020:023 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold. 02:020:024 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee. 02:020:025 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. 02:020:026 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon. 02:021:001 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them. 02:021:002 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. 02:021:003 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him. 02:021:004 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. 02:021:005 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: 02:021:006 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever. 02:021:007 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do. 02:021:008 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. 02:021:009 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. 02:021:010 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish. 02:021:011 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money. 02:021:012 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death. 02:021:013 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee. 02:021:014 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die. 02:021:015 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death. 02:021:016 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death. 02:021:017 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death. 02:021:018 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed: 02:021:019 If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed. 02:021:020 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished. 02:021:021 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money. 02:021:022 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. 02:021:023 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, 02:021:024 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 02:021:025 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. 02:021:026 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake. 02:021:027 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake. 02:021:028 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit. 02:021:029 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death. 02:021:030 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. 02:021:031 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him. 02:021:032 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. 02:021:033 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; 02:021:034 The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his. 02:021:035 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide. 02:021:036 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own. 02:022:001 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep. 02:022:002 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him. 02:022:003 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. 02:022:004 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double. 02:022:005 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution. 02:022:006 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution. 02:022:007 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double. 02:022:008 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods. 02:022:009 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour. 02:022:010 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it: 02:022:011 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good. 02:022:012 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof. 02:022:013 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn. 02:022:014 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good. 02:022:015 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire. 02:022:016 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife. 02:022:017 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins. 02:022:018 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live. 02:022:019 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death. 02:022:020 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed. 02:022:021 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 02:022:022 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. 02:022:023 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry; 02:022:024 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless. 02:022:025 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury. 02:022:026 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: 02:022:027 For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious. 02:022:028 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people. 02:022:029 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me. 02:022:030 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me. 02:022:031 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs. 02:023:001 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness. 02:023:002 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment: 02:023:003 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause. 02:023:004 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. 02:023:005 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him. 02:023:006 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause. 02:023:007 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked. 02:023:008 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous. 02:023:009 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 02:023:010 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof: 02:023:011 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard. 02:023:012 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. 02:023:013 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth. 02:023:014 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. 02:023:015 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:) 02:023:016 And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field. 02:023:017 Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the LORD God. 02:023:018 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning. 02:023:019 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. 02:023:020 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 02:023:021 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him. 02:023:022 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. 02:023:023 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off. 02:023:024 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images. 02:023:025 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. 02:023:026 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil. 02:023:027 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. 02:023:028 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. 02:023:029 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee. 02:023:030 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land. 02:023:031 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee. 02:023:032 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. 02:023:033 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee. 02:024:001 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off. 02:024:002 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him. 02:024:003 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do. 02:024:004 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel. 02:024:005 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD. 02:024:006 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 02:024:007 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient. 02:024:008 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words. 02:024:009 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel: 02:024:010 And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness. 02:024:011 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink. 02:024:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them. 02:024:013 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God. 02:024:014 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them. 02:024:015 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. 02:024:016 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. 02:024:017 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. 02:024:018 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights. 02:025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 02:025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering. 02:025:003 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass, 02:025:004 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, 02:025:005 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood, 02:025:006 Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense, 02:025:007 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate. 02:025:008 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. 02:025:009 According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it. 02:025:010 And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. 02:025:011 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. 02:025:012 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it. 02:025:013 And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. 02:025:014 And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them. 02:025:015 The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it. 02:025:016 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee. 02:025:017 And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof. 02:025:018 And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat. 02:025:019 And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof. 02:025:020 And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be. 02:025:021 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. 02:025:022 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel. 02:025:023 Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. 02:025:024 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about. 02:025:025 And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about. 02:025:026 And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof. 02:025:027 Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table. 02:025:028 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them. 02:025:029 And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them. 02:025:030 And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway. 02:025:031 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same. 02:025:032 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side: 02:025:033 Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick. 02:025:034 And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers. 02:025:035 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick. 02:025:036 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold. 02:025:037 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it. 02:025:038 And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold. 02:025:039 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels. 02:025:040 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount. 02:026:001 Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them. 02:026:002 The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of the curtains shall have one measure. 02:026:003 The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another;

that the loops may take hold one of another. 02:026:006 And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one tabernacle. 02:026:007 And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make. 02:026:008 The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains shall be all of one measure. 02:026:009 And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle. 02:026:010 And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second. 02:026:011 And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one. 02:026:012 And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle. 02:026:013 And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it. 02:026:014 And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins. 02:026:015 And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up. 02:026:016 Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half shall be the breadth of one board. 02:026:017 Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one against another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 02:026:018 And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward. 02:026:019 And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons. 02:026:020 And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side there shall be twenty boards: 02:026:021 And their forty sockets of silver;

that they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for ever unto him and his seed after him. 02:029:001 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one young bullock, and two rams without blemish, 02:029:002 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour shalt thou make them. 02:029:003 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket, with the bullock and the two rams. 02:029:004 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with water. 02:029:005 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod: 02:029:006 And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy crown upon the mitre. 02:029:007 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him. 02:029:008 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them. 02:029:009 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate Aaron and his sons. 02:029:010 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock. 02:029:011 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 02:029:012 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood beside the bottom of the altar. 02:029:013 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar. 02:029:014 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin offering. 02:029:015 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. 02:029:016 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the altar. 02:029:017 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his head. 02:029:018 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 02:029:019 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. 02:029:020 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 02:029:021 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him. 02:029:022 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration: 02:029:023 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD: 02:029:024 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD. 02:029:025 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 02:029:026 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy part. 02:029:027 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons: 02:029:028 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD. 02:029:029 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them. 02:029:030 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister in the holy place. 02:029:031 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place. 02:029:032 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 02:029:033 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy. 02:029:034 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy. 02:029:035 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them. 02:029:036 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. 02:029:037 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy. 02:029:038 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually. 02:029:039 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even: 02:029:040 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering. 02:029:041 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 02:029:042 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee. 02:029:043 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory. 02:029:044 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office. 02:029:045 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. 02:029:046 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the LORD their God. 02:030:001 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt thou make it. 02:030:002 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same. 02:030:003 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. 02:030:004 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. 02:030:005 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. 02:030:006 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. 02:030:007 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. 02:030:008 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. 02:030:009 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon. 02:030:010 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD. 02:030:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 02:030:012 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them. 02:030:013 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the offering of the LORD. 02:030:014 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD. 02:030:015 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. 02:030:016 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. 02:030:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 02:030:018 Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. 02:030:019 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: 02:030:020 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD: 02:030:021 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations. 02:030:022 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 02:030:023 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels, 02:030:024 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin: 02:030:025 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil. 02:030:026 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony, 02:030:027 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense, 02:030:028 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot. 02:030:029 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy. 02:030:030 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office. 02:030:031 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. 02:030:032 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you. 02:030:033 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people. 02:030:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight: 02:030:035 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy: 02:030:036 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy. 02:030:037 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD. 02:030:038 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people. 02:031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 02:031:002 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: 02:031:003 And I have filled him with the spirit of God,
