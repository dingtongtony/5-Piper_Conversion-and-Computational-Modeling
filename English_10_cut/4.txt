in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, 02:031:004 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 02:031:005 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. 02:031:006 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee; 02:031:007 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle, 02:031:008 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense, 02:031:009 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot, 02:031:010 And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office, 02:031:011 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do. 02:031:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 02:031:013 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you. 02:031:014 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 02:031:015 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. 02:031:016 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. 02:031:017 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. 02:031:018 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God. 02:032:001 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 02:032:002 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. 02:032:003 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron. 02:032:004 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 02:032:005 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD. 02:032:006 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. 02:032:007 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: 02:032:008 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 02:032:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 02:032:010 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. 02:032:011 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? 02:032:012 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. 02:032:013 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. 02:032:014 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people. 02:032:015 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. 02:032:016 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 02:032:017 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp. 02:032:018 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear. 02:032:019 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. 02:032:020 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it. 02:032:021 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? 02:032:022 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief. 02:032:023 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 02:032:024 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. 02:032:025 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) 02:032:026 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. 02:032:027 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. 02:032:028 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 02:032:029 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. 02:032:030 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. 02:032:031 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 02:032:032 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 02:032:033 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. 02:032:034 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. 02:032:035 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made. 02:033:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it: 02:033:002 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 02:033:003 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way. 02:033:004 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. 02:033:005 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. 02:033:006 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb. 02:033:007 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp. 02:033:008 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. 02:033:009 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses. 02:033:010 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door. 02:033:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. 02:033:012 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight. 02:033:013 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people. 02:033:014 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest. 02:033:015 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. 02:033:016 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth. 02:033:017 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. 02:033:018 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. 02:033:019 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. 02:033:020 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. 02:033:021 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: 02:033:022 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 02:033:023 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen. 02:034:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest. 02:034:002 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. 02:034:003 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. 02:034:004 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone. 02:034:005 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. 02:034:006 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, 02:034:007 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation. 02:034:008 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped. 02:034:009 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance. 02:034:010 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee. 02:034:011 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 02:034:012 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: 02:034:013 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: 02:034:014 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God: 02:034:015 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 02:034:016 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods. 02:034:017 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. 02:034:018 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. 02:034:019 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male. 02:034:020 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty. 02:034:021 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. 02:034:022 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end. 02:034:023 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel. 02:034:024 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year. 02:034:025 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. 02:034:026 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. 02:034:027 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. 02:034:028 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. 02:034:029 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. 02:034:030 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. 02:034:031 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. 02:034:032 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. 02:034:033 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face. 02:034:034 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. 02:034:035 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him. 02:035:001 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them. 02:035:002 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death. 02:035:003 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day. 02:035:004 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying, 02:035:005 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass, 02:035:006 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, 02:035:007 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood, 02:035:008 And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense, 02:035:009 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate. 02:035:010 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD hath commanded; 02:035:011 The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets, 02:035:012 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the vail of the covering, 02:035:013 The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread, 02:035:014 The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light, 02:035:015 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle, 02:035:016 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot, 02:035:017 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court, 02:035:018 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords, 02:035:019 The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office. 02:035:020 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. 02:035:021 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments. 02:035:022 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD. 02:035:023 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them. 02:035:024 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it. 02:035:025 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen. 02:035:026 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair. 02:035:027 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; 02:035:028 And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense. 02:035:029 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses. 02:035:030 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; 02:035:031 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; 02:035:032 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 02:035:033 And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work. 02:035:034 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 02:035:035 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work. 02:036:001 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded. 02:036:002 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 02:036:003 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning. 02:036:004 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made; 02:036:005 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make. 02:036:006 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing. 02:036:007 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much. 02:036:008 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them. 02:036:009 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size. 02:036:010 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another. 02:036:011 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second. 02:036:012 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another. 02:036:013 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle. 02:036:014 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. 02:036:015 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size. 02:036:016 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. 02:036:017 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second. 02:036:018 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one. 02:036:019 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that. 02:036:020 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up. 02:036:021 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half. 02:036:022 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 02:036:023 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward: 02:036:024 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons. 02:036:025 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards, 02:036:026 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board. 02:036:027 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. 02:036:028 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides. 02:036:029 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners. 02:036:030 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets. 02:036:031 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 02:036:032 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward. 02:036:033 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other. 02:036:034 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. 02:036:035 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work. 02:036:036 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver. 02:036:037 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework; 02:036:038 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass. 02:037:001 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it: 02:037:002 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about. 02:037:003 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it. 02:037:004 And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. 02:037:005 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark. 02:037:006 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof. 02:037:007 And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat; 02:037:008 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof. 02:037:009 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims. 02:037:010 And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof: 02:037:011 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about. 02:037:012 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about. 02:037:013 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof. 02:037:014 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table. 02:037:015 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table. 02:037:016 And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure gold. 02:037:017 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same: 02:037:018 And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof: 02:037:019 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick. 02:037:020 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers: 02:037:021 And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it. 02:037:022 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold. 02:037:023 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, of pure gold. 02:037:024 Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof. 02:037:025 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same. 02:037:026 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about. 02:037:027 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear it withal. 02:037:028 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold. 02:037:029 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary. 02:038:001 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it was foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof. 02:038:002 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass. 02:038:003 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass. 02:038:004 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it. 02:038:005 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves. 02:038:006 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with brass. 02:038:007 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards. 02:038:008 And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 02:038:009 And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits: 02:038:010 Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver. 02:038:011 And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits, their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. 02:038:012 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver. 02:038:013 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits. 02:038:014 The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. 02:038:015 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three. 02:038:016 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen. 02:038:017 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver. 02:038:018 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court. 02:038:019 And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four; their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their fillets of silver. 02:038:020 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round about, were of brass. 02:038:021 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest. 02:038:022 And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses. 02:038:023 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen. 02:038:024 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 02:038:025 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 02:038:026 A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men. 02:038:027 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. 02:038:028 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted them. 02:038:029 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels. 02:038:030 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar, 02:038:031 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round about. 02:039:001 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses. 02:039:002 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 02:039:003 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work. 02:039:004 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together. 02:039:005 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses. 02:039:006 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel. 02:039:007 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses. 02:039:008 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 02:039:009 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled. 02:039:010 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row. 02:039:011 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond. 02:039:012 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. 02:039:013 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings. 02:039:014 And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes. 02:039:015 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold. 02:039:016 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate. 02:039:017 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate. 02:039:018 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it. 02:039:019 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward. 02:039:020 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. 02:039:021 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses. 02:039:022 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue. 02:039:023 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend. 02:039:024 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen. 02:039:025 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates; 02:039:026 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses. 02:039:027 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, 02:039:028 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen, 02:039:029 And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses. 02:039:030 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD. 02:039:031 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses. 02:039:032 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they. 02:039:033 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets, 02:039:034 And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering, 02:039:035 The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat, 02:039:036 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread, 02:039:037 The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light, 02:039:038 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door, 02:039:039 The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot, 02:039:040 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation, 02:039:041 The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office. 02:039:042 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work. 02:039:043 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them. 02:040:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 02:040:002 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 02:040:003 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail. 02:040:004 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. 02:040:005 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. 02:040:006 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 02:040:007 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein. 02:040:008 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate. 02:040:009 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy. 02:040:010 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. 02:040:011 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. 02:040:012 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. 02:040:013 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. 02:040:014 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 02:040:015 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. 02:040:016 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he. 02:040:017 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up. 02:040:018 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars. 02:040:019 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses. 02:040:020 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 02:040:021 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses. 02:040:022 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. 02:040:023 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses. 02:040:024 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 02:040:025 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. 02:040:026 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail: 02:040:027 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses. 02:040:028 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle. 02:040:029 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses. 02:040:030 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal. 02:040:031 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat: 02:040:032 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses. 02:040:033 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. 02:040:034 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 02:040:035 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 02:040:036 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 02:040:037 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. 02:040:038 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys. Book 03 Leviticus 03:001:001 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 03:001:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the flock. 03:001:003 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD. 03:001:004 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. 03:001:005 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 03:001:006 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces. 03:001:007 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire: 03:001:008 And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 03:001:009 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 03:001:010 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish. 03:001:011 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar. 03:001:012 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar: 03:001:013 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 03:001:014 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons. 03:001:015 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar: 03:001:016 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes: 03:001:017 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 03:002:001 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon: 03:002:002 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: 03:002:003 And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire. 03:002:004 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil. 03:002:005 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. 03:002:006 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering. 03:002:007 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. 03:002:008 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar. 03:002:009 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 03:002:010 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire. 03:002:011 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire. 03:002:012 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour. 03:002:013 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt. 03:002:014 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears. 03:002:015 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering. 03:002:016 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 03:003:001 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD. 03:003:002 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 03:003:003 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 03:003:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. 03:003:005 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 03:003:006 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish. 03:003:007 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the LORD. 03:003:008 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar. 03:003:009 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 03:003:010 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. 03:003:011 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD. 03:003:012 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD. 03:003:013 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about. 03:003:014 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 03:003:015 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. 03:003:016 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the LORD's. 03:003:017 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood. 03:004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:004:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them: 03:004:003 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering. 03:004:004 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD. 03:004:005 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 03:004:006 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary. 03:004:007 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 03:004:008 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards, 03:004:009 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away, 03:004:010 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering. 03:004:011 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 03:004:012 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt. 03:004:013 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty; 03:004:014 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation. 03:004:015 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD. 03:004:016 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation: 03:004:017 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail. 03:004:018 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 03:004:019 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar. 03:004:020 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them. 03:004:021 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation. 03:004:022 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty; 03:004:023 Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish: 03:004:024 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering. 03:004:025 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering. 03:004:026 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. 03:004:027 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty; 03:004:028 Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned. 03:004:029 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering. 03:004:030 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar. 03:004:031 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him. 03:004:032 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish. 03:004:033 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering. 03:004:034 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar: 03:004:035 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him. 03:005:001 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity. 03:005:002 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty. 03:005:003 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty. 03:005:004 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these. 03:005:005 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that thing: 03:005:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin. 03:005:007 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering. 03:005:008 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder: 03:005:009 And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering. 03:005:010 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him. 03:005:011 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering. 03:005:012 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it is a sin offering. 03:005:013 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat offering. 03:005:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:005:015 If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering. 03:005:016 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him. 03:005:017 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. 03:005:018 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be forgiven him. 03:005:019 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD. 03:006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:006:002 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 03:006:003 Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 03:006:004 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found, 03:006:005 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass offering. 03:006:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: 03:006:007 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein. 03:006:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:006:009 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it. 03:006:010 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. 03:006:011 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. 03:006:012 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings. 03:006:013 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out. 03:006:014 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar. 03:006:015 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the LORD. 03:006:016 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it. 03:006:017 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering. 03:006:018 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy. 03:006:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:006:020 This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night. 03:006:021 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 03:006:022 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt. 03:006:023 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten. 03:006:024 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:006:025 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy. 03:006:026 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation. 03:006:027 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place. 03:006:028 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water. 03:006:029 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most holy. 03:006:030 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire. 03:007:001 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy. 03:007:002 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar. 03:007:003 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, 03:007:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 03:007:005 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering. 03:007:006 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy. 03:007:007 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it. 03:007:008 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered. 03:007:009 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it. 03:007:010 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another. 03:007:011 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD. 03:007:012 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried. 03:007:013 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings. 03:007:014 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings. 03:007:015 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. 03:007:016 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten: 03:007:017 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire. 03:007:018 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity. 03:007:019 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof. 03:007:020 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 03:007:021 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 03:007:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:007:023 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat. 03:007:024 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it. 03:007:025 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. 03:007:026 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. 03:007:027 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 03:007:028 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:007:029 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings. 03:007:030 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD. 03:007:031 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'. 03:007:032 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. 03:007:033 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part. 03:007:034 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel. 03:007:035 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office; 03:007:036 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations. 03:007:037 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; 03:007:038 Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai. 03:008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:008:002 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; 03:008:003 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 03:008:004 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 03:008:005 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which the LORD commanded to be done. 03:008:006 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. 03:008:007 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith. 03:008:008 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim. 03:008:009 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses. 03:008:010 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them. 03:008:011 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them. 03:008:012 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. 03:008:013 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses. 03:008:014 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering. 03:008:015 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it. 03:008:016 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned it upon the altar. 03:008:017 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses. 03:008:018 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 03:008:019 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. 03:008:020 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat. 03:008:021 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. 03:008:022 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 03:008:023 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 03:008:024 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. 03:008:025 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder: 03:008:026 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right shoulder: 03:008:027 And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD. 03:008:028 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 03:008:029 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses. 03:008:030 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him. 03:008:031 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it. 03:008:032 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire. 03:008:033 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you. 03:008:034 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you. 03:008:035 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded. 03:008:036 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses. 03:009:001 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; 03:009:002 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD. 03:009:003 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 03:009:004 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you. 03:009:005 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD. 03:009:006 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you. 03:009:007 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded. 03:009:008 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. 03:009:009 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 03:009:010 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses. 03:009:011 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp. 03:009:012 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar. 03:009:013 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar. 03:009:014 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar. 03:009:015 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. 03:009:016 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner. 03:009:017 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning. 03:009:018 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 03:009:019 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver: 03:009:020 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar: 03:009:021 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded. 03:009:022 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings. 03:009:023 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people. 03:009:024 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces. 03:010:001 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not. 03:010:002 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD. 03:010:003 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace. 03:010:004 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp. 03:010:005 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said. 03:010:006 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled. 03:010:007 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses. 03:010:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 03:010:009 Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations: 03:010:010 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; 03:010:011 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses. 03:010:012 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy: 03:010:013 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded. 03:010:014 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall
