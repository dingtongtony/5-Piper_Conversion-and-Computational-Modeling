ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel. 03:010:015 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded. 03:010:016 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying, 03:010:017 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD? 03:010:018 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded. 03:010:019 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD? 03:010:020 And when Moses heard that, he was content. 03:011:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, 03:011:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth. 03:011:003 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. 03:011:004 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. 03:011:005 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. 03:011:006 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. 03:011:007 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you. 03:011:008 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you. 03:011:009 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat. 03:011:010 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you: 03:011:011 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination. 03:011:012 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you. 03:011:013 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, 03:011:014 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind; 03:011:015 Every raven after his kind; 03:011:016 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 03:011:017 And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, 03:011:018 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, 03:011:019 And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. 03:011:020 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you. 03:011:021 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth; 03:011:022 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind. 03:011:023 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you. 03:011:024 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even. 03:011:025 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. 03:011:026 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean. 03:011:027 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even. 03:011:028 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto you. 03:011:029 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind, 03:011:030 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole. 03:011:031 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even. 03:011:032 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed. 03:011:033 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth, whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it. 03:011:034 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean. 03:011:035 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you. 03:011:036 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean. 03:011:037 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean. 03:011:038 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you. 03:011:039 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even. 03:011:040 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even. 03:011:041 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten. 03:011:042 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination. 03:011:043 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby. 03:011:044 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 03:011:045 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am holy. 03:011:046 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth: 03:011:047 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten. 03:012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:012:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean. 03:012:003 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. 03:012:004 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled. 03:012:005 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days. 03:012:006 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest: 03:012:007 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female. 03:012:008 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean. 03:013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 03:013:002 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests: 03:013:003 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean. 03:013:004 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days: 03:013:005 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more: 03:013:006 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 03:013:007 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again. 03:013:008 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy. 03:013:009 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest; 03:013:010 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising; 03:013:011 It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean. 03:013:012 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; 03:013:013 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean. 03:013:014 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean. 03:013:015 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy. 03:013:016 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest; 03:013:017 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: he is clean. 03:013:018 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed, 03:013:019 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest; 03:013:020 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil. 03:013:021 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 03:013:022 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague. 03:013:023 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. 03:013:024 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white; 03:013:025 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. 03:013:026 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 03:013:027 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy. 03:013:028 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning. 03:013:029 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard; 03:013:030 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard. 03:013:031 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the scall seven days: 03:013:032 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin; 03:013:033 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more: 03:013:034 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 03:013:035 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing; 03:013:036 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean. 03:013:037 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean. 03:013:038 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots; 03:013:039 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean. 03:013:040 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean. 03:013:041 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean. 03:013:042 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead. 03:013:043 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh; 03:013:044 He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head. 03:013:045 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean. 03:013:046 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be. 03:013:047 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woollen garment, or a linen garment; 03:013:048 Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin; 03:013:049 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest: 03:013:050 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that hath the plague seven days: 03:013:051 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean. 03:013:052 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire. 03:013:053 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; 03:013:054 Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more: 03:013:055 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without. 03:013:056 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: 03:013:057 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire. 03:013:058 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean. 03:013:059 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean. 03:014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:014:002 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest: 03:014:003 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper; 03:014:004 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: 03:014:005 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water: 03:014:006 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water: 03:014:007 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field. 03:014:008 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days. 03:014:009 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean. 03:014:010 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil. 03:014:011 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: 03:014:012 And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: 03:014:013 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass offering: it is most holy: 03:014:014 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot: 03:014:015 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand: 03:014:016 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD: 03:014:017 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering: 03:014:018 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD. 03:014:019 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering: 03:014:020 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean. 03:014:021 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil; 03:014:022 And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering. 03:014:023 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the LORD. 03:014:024 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: 03:014:025 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot: 03:014:026 And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand: 03:014:027 And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD: 03:014:028 And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering: 03:014:029 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the LORD. 03:014:030 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get; 03:014:031 Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD. 03:014:032 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing. 03:014:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 03:014:034 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession; 03:014:035 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the house: 03:014:036 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house: 03:014:037 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall; 03:014:038 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days: 03:014:039 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the house; 03:014:040 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city: 03:014:041 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place: 03:014:042 And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house. 03:014:043 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered; 03:014:044 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean. 03:014:045 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place. 03:014:046 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even. 03:014:047 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. 03:014:048 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed. 03:014:049 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: 03:014:050 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water: 03:014:051 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times: 03:014:052 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet: 03:014:053 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean. 03:014:054 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall, 03:014:055 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house, 03:014:056 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot: 03:014:057 To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy. 03:015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 03:015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his issue he is unclean. 03:015:003 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it is his uncleanness. 03:015:004 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean. 03:015:005 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 03:015:006 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 03:015:007 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 03:015:008 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 03:015:009 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be unclean. 03:015:010 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 03:015:011 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 03:015:012 And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water. 03:015:013 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean. 03:015:014 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the priest: 03:015:015 And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue. 03:015:016 And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even. 03:015:017 And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even. 03:015:018 The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the even. 03:015:019 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean until the even. 03:015:020 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean. 03:015:021 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 03:015:022 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 03:015:023 And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even. 03:015:024 And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean. 03:015:025 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean. 03:015:026 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation. 03:015:027 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even. 03:015:028 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean. 03:015:029 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 03:015:030 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness. 03:015:031 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them. 03:015:032 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith; 03:015:033 And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean. 03:016:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died; 03:016:002 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat. 03:016:003 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering. 03:016:004 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on. 03:016:005 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering. 03:016:006 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house. 03:016:007 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 03:016:008 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat. 03:016:009 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering. 03:016:010 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness. 03:016:011 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself: 03:016:012 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail: 03:016:013 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony, that he die not: 03:016:014 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times. 03:016:015 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat: 03:016:016 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness. 03:016:017 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel. 03:016:018 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about. 03:016:019 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel. 03:016:020 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat: 03:016:021 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness: 03:016:022 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness. 03:016:023 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy place, and shall leave them there: 03:016:024 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people. 03:016:025 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar. 03:016:026 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp. 03:016:027 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung. 03:016:028 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp. 03:016:029 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you: 03:016:030 For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD. 03:016:031 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever. 03:016:032 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the holy garments: 03:016:033 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation. 03:016:034 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses. 03:017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:017:002 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, saying, 03:017:003 What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out of the camp, 03:017:004 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people: 03:017:005 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the LORD. 03:017:006 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 03:017:007 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations. 03:017:008 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice, 03:017:009 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people. 03:017:010 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people. 03:017:011 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul. 03:017:012 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. 03:017:013 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust. 03:017:014 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off. 03:017:015 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean. 03:017:016 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity. 03:018:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:018:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your God. 03:018:003 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances. 03:018:004 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the LORD your God. 03:018:005 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD. 03:018:006 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD. 03:018:007 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 03:018:008 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy father's nakedness. 03:018:009 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover. 03:018:010 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs is thine own nakedness. 03:018:011 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 03:018:012 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister: she is thy father's near kinswoman. 03:018:013 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's near kinswoman. 03:018:014 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt. 03:018:015 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 03:018:016 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness. 03:018:017 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness. 03:018:018 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time. 03:018:019 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness. 03:018:020 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her. 03:018:021 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD. 03:018:022 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination. 03:018:023 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it is confusion. 03:018:024 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you: 03:018:025 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants. 03:018:026 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you: 03:018:027 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;) 03:018:028 That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out the nations that were before you. 03:018:029 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people. 03:018:030 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs, which were committed before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD your God. 03:019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:019:002 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy. 03:019:003 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God. 03:019:004 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God. 03:019:005 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will. 03:019:006 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire. 03:019:007 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted. 03:019:008 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 03:019:009 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest. 03:019:010 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God. 03:019:011 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another. 03:019:012 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD. 03:019:013 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning. 03:019:014 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD. 03:019:015 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour. 03:019:016 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour; I am the LORD. 03:019:017 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him. 03:019:018 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD. 03:019:019 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee. 03:019:020 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. 03:019:021 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering. 03:019:022 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him. 03:019:023 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of. 03:019:024 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal. 03:019:025 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God. 03:019:026 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times. 03:019:027 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. 03:019:028 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD. 03:019:029 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness. 03:019:030 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD. 03:019:031 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God. 03:019:032 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD. 03:019:033 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him. 03:019:034 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 03:019:035 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. 03:019:036 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt. 03:019:037 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD. 03:020:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:020:002 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones. 03:020:003 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. 03:020:004 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not: 03:020:005 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people. 03:020:006 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. 03:020:007 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God. 03:020:008 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you. 03:020:009 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him. 03:020:010 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. 03:020:011 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 03:020:012 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them. 03:020:013 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 03:020:014 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you. 03:020:015 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast. 03:020:016 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. 03:020:017 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity. 03:020:018 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people. 03:020:019 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity. 03:020:020 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless. 03:020:021 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless. 03:020:022 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out. 03:020:023 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. 03:020:024 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people. 03:020:025 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean. 03:020:026 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine. 03:020:027 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them. 03:021:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people: 03:021:002 But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother. 03:021:003 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled. 03:021:004 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself. 03:021:005 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. 03:021:006 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy. 03:021:007 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his God. 03:021:008 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, am holy. 03:021:009 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire. 03:021:010 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes; 03:021:011 Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; 03:021:012 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the LORD. 03:021:013 And he shall take a wife in her virginity. 03:021:014 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife. 03:021:015 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him. 03:021:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:021:017 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God. 03:021:018 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous, 03:021:019 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded, 03:021:020 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; 03:021:021 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God. 03:021:022 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy. 03:021:023 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them. 03:021:024 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel. 03:022:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:022:002 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me: I am the LORD. 03:022:003 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD. 03:022:004 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him; 03:022:005 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; 03:022:006 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water. 03:022:007 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food. 03:022:008 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD. 03:022:009 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them. 03:022:010 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing. 03:022:011 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat. 03:022:012 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things. 03:022:013 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be no stranger eat thereof. 03:022:014 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing. 03:022:015 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD; 03:022:016 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them. 03:022:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:022:018 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering; 03:022:019 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats. 03:022:020 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you. 03:022:021 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein. 03:022:022 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD. 03:022:023 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted. 03:022:024 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land. 03:022:025 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you. 03:022:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:022:027 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 03:022:028 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day. 03:022:029 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer it at your own will. 03:022:030 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD. 03:022:031 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD. 03:022:032 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you, 03:022:033 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD. 03:023:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:023:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts. 03:023:003 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings. 03:023:004 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons. 03:023:005 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's passover. 03:023:006 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread. 03:023:007 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein. 03:023:008 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein. 03:023:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:023:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: 03:023:011 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. 03:023:012 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD. 03:023:013 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of an hin. 03:023:014 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 03:023:015 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete: 03:023:016 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD. 03:023:017 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD. 03:023:018 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD. 03:023:019 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings. 03:023:020 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest. 03:023:021 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations. 03:023:022 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God. 03:023:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:023:024 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation. 03:023:025 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 03:023:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:023:027 Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 03:023:028 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God. 03:023:029 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people. 03:023:030 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people. 03:023:031 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 03:023:032 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath. 03:023:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:023:034 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD. 03:023:035 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein. 03:023:036 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein. 03:023:037 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day: 03:023:038 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD. 03:023:039 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath. 03:023:040 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days. 03:023:041 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month. 03:023:042 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths: 03:023:043 That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 03:023:044 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD. 03:024:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:024:002 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually. 03:024:003 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations. 03:024:004 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually. 03:024:005 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake. 03:024:006 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD. 03:024:007 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 03:024:008 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant. 03:024:009 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute. 03:024:010 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp; 03:024:011 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:) 03:024:012 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them. 03:024:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:024:014 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him. 03:024:015 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. 03:024:016 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death. 03:024:017 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death. 03:024:018 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast. 03:024:019 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him; 03:024:020 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again. 03:024:021 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death. 03:024:022 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God. 03:024:023 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses. 03:025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 03:025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD. 03:025:003 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 03:025:004 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. 03:025:005 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a year of rest unto the land. 03:025:006 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee. 03:025:007 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat. 03:025:008 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years. 03:025:009 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. 03:025:010 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. 03:025:011 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed. 03:025:012 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field. 03:025:013 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession. 03:025:014 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another: 03:025:015 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee: 03:025:016 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee. 03:025:017 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am the LORD your God. 03:025:018 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. 03:025:019 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety. 03:025:020 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 03:025:021 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years. 03:025:022 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store. 03:025:023 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for ye are strangers and sojourners with me. 03:025:024 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land. 03:025:025 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold. 03:025:026 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it; 03:025:027 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession. 03:025:028 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession. 03:025:029 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it. 03:025:030 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile. 03:025:031 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile. 03:025:032 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time. 03:025:033 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel. 03:025:034 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession. 03:025:035 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee. 03:025:036 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee. 03:025:037 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase. 03:025:038 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God. 03:025:039 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant: 03:025:040 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile. 03:025:041 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return. 03:025:042 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen. 03:025:043 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God. 03:025:044 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. 03:025:045 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession. 03:025:046 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour. 03:025:047 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family: 03:025:048 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him: 03:025:049 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself. 03:025:050 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him. 03:025:051 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. 03:025:052 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption. 03:025:053 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight. 03:025:054 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him. 03:025:055 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. 03:026:001 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God. 03:026:002 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD. 03:026:003 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; 03:026:004 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. 03:026:005 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. 03:026:006 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. 03:026:007 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. 03:026:008 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. 03:026:009 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you. 03:026:010 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new. 03:026:011 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. 03:026:012 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people. 03:026:013 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright. 03:026:014 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; 03:026:015 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break my covenant: 03:026:016 I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. 03:026:017 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. 03:026:018 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins. 03:026:019 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 03:026:020 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits. 03:026:021 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. 03:026:022 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your high ways shall be desolate. 03:026:023 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me; 03:026:024 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins. 03:026:025 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. 03:026:026 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. 03:026:027 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; 03:026:028 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your
