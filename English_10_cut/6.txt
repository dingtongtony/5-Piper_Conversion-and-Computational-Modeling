sins. 03:026:029 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. 03:026:030 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. 03:026:031 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. 03:026:032 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it. 03:026:033 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. 03:026:034 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. 03:026:035 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. 03:026:036 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. 03:026:037 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. 03:026:038 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. 03:026:039 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. 03:026:040 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me; 03:026:041 And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: 03:026:042 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. 03:026:043 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes. 03:026:044 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God. 03:026:045 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD. 03:026:046 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses. 03:027:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 03:027:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation. 03:027:003 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 03:027:004 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. 03:027:005 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 03:027:006 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver. 03:027:007 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 03:027:008 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him. 03:027:009 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy. 03:027:010 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy. 03:027:011 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest: 03:027:012 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be. 03:027:013 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation. 03:027:014 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand. 03:027:015 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his. 03:027:016 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. 03:027:017 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand. 03:027:018 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation. 03:027:019 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him. 03:027:020 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more. 03:027:021 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's. 03:027:022 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the fields of his possession; 03:027:023 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD. 03:027:024 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong. 03:027:025 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel. 03:027:026 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD's. 03:027:027 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation. 03:027:028 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD. 03:027:029 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death. 03:027:030 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy unto the LORD. 03:027:031 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof. 03:027:032 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD. 03:027:033 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed. 03:027:034 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai. Book 04 Numbers 04:001:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 04:001:002 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls; 04:001:003 From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies. 04:001:004 And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers. 04:001:005 And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur. 04:001:006 Of Simeon; Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 04:001:007 Of Judah;

Ahira the son of Enan. 04:001:016 These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel. 04:001:017 And Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by their names: 04:001:018 And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls. 04:001:019 As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai. 04:001:020 And the children of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war;

04:001:046 Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. 04:001:047 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them. 04:001:048 For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying, 04:001:049 Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel: 04:001:050 But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle. 04:001:051 And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 04:001:052 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts. 04:001:053 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony. 04:001:054 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they. 04:002:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 04:002:002 Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch. 04:002:003 And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armies: and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of the children of Judah. 04:002:004 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred. 04:002:005 And those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar: and Nethaneel the son of Zuar shall be captain of the children of Issachar. 04:002:006 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred. 04:002:007 Then the tribe of Zebulun: and Eliab the son of Helon shall be captain of the children of Zebulun. 04:002:008 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred. 04:002:009 All that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred, throughout their armies. These shall first set forth. 04:002:010 On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their armies: and the captain of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur. 04:002:011 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty and six thousand and five hundred. 04:002:012 And those which pitch by him shall be the tribe of Simeon: and the captain of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 04:002:013 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred. 04:002:014 Then the tribe of Gad: and the captain of the sons of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel. 04:002:015 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty and five thousand and six hundred and fifty. 04:002:016 All that were numbered in the camp of Reuben were an hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty, throughout their armies. And they shall set forth in the second rank. 04:002:017 Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp: as they encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place by their standards. 04:002:018 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their armies: and the captain of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud. 04:002:019 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty thousand and five hundred. 04:002:020 And by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh: and the captain of the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 04:002:021 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred. 04:002:022 Then the tribe of Benjamin: and the captain of the sons of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni. 04:002:023 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred. 04:002:024 All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were an hundred thousand and eight thousand and an hundred, throughout their armies.

They shall go hindmost with their standards. 04:002:032 These are those which were numbered of the children of Israel by the house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. 04:002:033 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses. 04:002:034 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so they set forward, every one after their families, according to the house of their fathers. 04:003:001 These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai. 04:003:002 And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 04:003:003 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office. 04:003:004 And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father. 04:003:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:003:006 Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him. 04:003:007 And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle. 04:003:008 And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. 04:003:009 And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel. 04:003:010 And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 04:003:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:003:012 And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine; 04:003:013 Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I am the LORD. 04:003:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, 04:003:015 Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. 04:003:016 And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded. 04:003:017 And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. 04:003:018 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families; Libni, and Shimei. 04:003:019 And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 04:003:020 And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to the house of their fathers. 04:003:021 Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites. 04:003:022 Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred. 04:003:023 The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward. 04:003:024 And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael. 04:003:025 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, 04:003:026 And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof. 04:003:027 And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the Kohathites. 04:003:028 In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary. 04:003:029 The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward. 04:003:030 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel. 04:003:031 And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof. 04:003:032 And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary. 04:003:033 Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these are the families of Merari. 04:003:034 And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six thousand and two hundred. 04:003:035 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward. 04:003:036 And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all that serveth thereto, 04:003:037 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords. 04:003:038 But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 04:003:039 All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand. 04:003:040 And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names. 04:003:041 And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel. 04:003:042 And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel. 04:003:043 And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen. 04:003:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:003:045 Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD. 04:003:046 And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites; 04:003:047 Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel is twenty gerahs:) 04:003:048 And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons. 04:003:049 And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites: 04:003:050 Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 04:003:051 And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses. 04:004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 04:004:002 Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers, 04:004:003 From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation. 04:004:004 This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things: 04:004:005 And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of testimony with it: 04:004:006 And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof. 04:004:007 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon: 04:004:008 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in the staves thereof. 04:004:009 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it: 04:004:010 And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar. 04:004:011 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put to the staves thereof: 04:004:012 And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put them on a bar: 04:004:013 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon: 04:004:014 And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and put to the staves of it. 04:004:015 And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation. 04:004:016 And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof. 04:004:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying, 04:004:018 Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites: 04:004:019 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden: 04:004:020 But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die. 04:004:021 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:004:022 Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their families; 04:004:023 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation. 04:004:024 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve, and for burdens: 04:004:025 And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, 04:004:026 And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and all that is made for them: so shall they serve. 04:004:027 At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens. 04:004:028 This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 04:004:029 As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their families, by the house of their fathers; 04:004:030 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation. 04:004:031 And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets thereof, 04:004:032 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service: and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden. 04:004:033 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 04:004:034 And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the house of their fathers, 04:004:035 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation: 04:004:036 And those that were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty. 04:004:037 These were they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 04:004:038 And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers, 04:004:039 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation, 04:004:040 Even those that were numbered of them, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and six hundred and thirty. 04:004:041 These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the LORD. 04:004:042 And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers, 04:004:043 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation, 04:004:044 Even those that were numbered of them after their families, were three thousand and two hundred. 04:004:045 These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 04:004:046 All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families, and after the house of their fathers, 04:004:047 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation. 04:004:048 Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore, 04:004:049 According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as the LORD commanded Moses. 04:005:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:005:002 Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead: 04:005:003 Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell. 04:005:004 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel. 04:005:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:005:006 Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty; 04:005:007 Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed. 04:005:008 But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him. 04:005:009 And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his. 04:005:010 And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his. 04:005:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:005:012 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him, 04:005:013 And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner; 04:005:014 And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled: 04:005:015 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance. 04:005:016 And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD: 04:005:017 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water: 04:005:018 And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse: 04:005:019 And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse: 04:005:020 But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband: 04:005:021 Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell; 04:005:022 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen. 04:005:023 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water: 04:005:024 And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter. 04:005:025 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar: 04:005:026 And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water. 04:005:027 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people. 04:005:028 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed. 04:005:029 This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband, and is defiled; 04:005:030 Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law. 04:005:031 Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity. 04:006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:006:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the LORD: 04:006:003 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried. 04:006:004 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk. 04:006:005 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow. 04:006:006 All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall come at no dead body. 04:006:007 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is upon his head. 04:006:008 All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD. 04:006:009 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it. 04:006:010 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: 04:006:011 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day. 04:006:012 And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled. 04:006:013 And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: 04:006:014 And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings, 04:006:015 And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings. 04:006:016 And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering: 04:006:017 And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering. 04:006:018 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings. 04:006:019 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his separation is shaven: 04:006:020 And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine. 04:006:021 This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the law of his separation. 04:006:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:006:023 Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them, 04:006:024 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee: 04:006:025 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: 04:006:026 The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. 04:006:027 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them. 04:007:001 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them; 04:007:002 That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered: 04:007:003 And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle. 04:007:004 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:007:005 Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service. 04:007:006 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. 04:007:007 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service: 04:007:008 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 04:007:009 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders. 04:007:010 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar. 04:007:011 And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar. 04:007:012 And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah: 04:007:013 And his offering was one silver charger, the weight thereof was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary;

both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering: 04:007:080 One golden spoon of ten shekels, full of incense: 04:007:081 One young bullock, one ram, one lamb of the first year, for a burnt offering: 04:007:082 One kid of the goats for a sin offering: 04:007:083 And for a sacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen, five rams, five he goats, five lambs of the first year: this was the offering of Ahira the son of Enan. 04:007:084 This was the dedication of the altar, in the day when it was anointed, by the princes of Israel: twelve chargers of silver, twelve silver bowls, twelve spoons of gold: 04:007:085 Each charger of silver weighing an hundred and thirty shekels, each bowl seventy: all the silver vessels weighed two thousand and four hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 04:007:086 The golden spoons were twelve, full of incense, weighing ten shekels apiece, after the shekel of the sanctuary: all the gold of the spoons was an hundred and twenty shekels. 04:007:087 All the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks, the rams twelve, the lambs of the first year twelve, with their meat offering: and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve. 04:007:088 And all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were twenty and four bullocks, the rams sixty, the he goats sixty, the lambs of the first year sixty. This was the dedication of the altar, after that it was anointed. 04:007:089 And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon the ark of testimony, from between the two cherubims: and he spake unto him. 04:008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:008:002 Speak unto Aaron and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick. 04:008:003 And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses. 04:008:004 And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick. 04:008:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:008:006 Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. 04:008:007 And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean. 04:008:008 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering. 04:008:009 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together: 04:008:010 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites: 04:008:011 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the LORD. 04:008:012 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for the Levites. 04:008:013 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering unto the LORD. 04:008:014 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine. 04:008:015 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for an offering. 04:008:016 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me. 04:008:017 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself. 04:008:018 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel. 04:008:019 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary. 04:008:020 And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them. 04:008:021 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them. 04:008:022 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them. 04:008:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:008:024 This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: 04:008:025 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more: 04:008:026 But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge. 04:009:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 04:009:002 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season. 04:009:003 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it. 04:009:004 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. 04:009:005 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. 04:009:006 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: 04:009:007 And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel? 04:009:008 And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you. 04:009:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:009:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD. 04:009:011 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 04:009:012 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it. 04:009:013 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. 04:009:014 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land. 04:009:015 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning. 04:009:016 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night. 04:009:017 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents. 04:009:018 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents. 04:009:019 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not. 04:009:020 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed. 04:009:021 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. 04:009:022 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed. 04:009:023 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 04:010:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:010:002 Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps. 04:010:003 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 04:010:004 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee. 04:010:005 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward. 04:010:006 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys. 04:010:007 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm. 04:010:008 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations. 04:010:009 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies. 04:010:010 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God. 04:010:011 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony. 04:010:012 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran. 04:010:013 And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 04:010:014 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab. 04:010:015 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar. 04:010:016 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon. 04:010:017 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle. 04:010:018 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur. 04:010:019 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 04:010:020 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel. 04:010:021 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came. 04:010:022 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud. 04:010:023 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 04:010:024 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni. 04:010:025 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. 04:010:026 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran. 04:010:027 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan. 04:010:028 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward. 04:010:029 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel. 04:010:030 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred. 04:010:031 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes. 04:010:032 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee. 04:010:033 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them. 04:010:034 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp. 04:010:035 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee. 04:010:036 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel. 04:011:001 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp. 04:011:002 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched. 04:011:003 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them. 04:011:004 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? 04:011:005 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick: 04:011:006 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes. 04:011:007 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium. 04:011:008 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. 04:011:009 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it. 04:011:010 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased. 04:011:011 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? 04:011:012 Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers? 04:011:013 Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. 04:011:014 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. 04:011:015 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness. 04:011:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee. 04:011:017 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone. 04:011:018 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. 04:011:019 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days; 04:011:020 But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt? 04:011:021 And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. 04:011:022 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them? 04:011:023 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not. 04:011:024 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle. 04:011:025 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease. 04:011:026 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp. 04:011:027 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. 04:011:028 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. 04:011:029 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them! 04:011:030 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. 04:011:031 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth. 04:011:032 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp. 04:011:033 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague. 04:011:034 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted. 04:011:035 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth. 04:012:001 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman. 04:012:002 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it. 04:012:003 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.) 04:012:004 And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out. 04:012:005 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth. 04:012:006 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream. 04:012:007 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house. 04:012:008 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses? 04:012:009 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed. 04:012:010 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous. 04:012:011 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned. 04:012:012 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb. 04:012:013 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee. 04:012:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again. 04:012:015 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again. 04:012:016 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran. 04:013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:013:002 Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them. 04:013:003 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel. 04:013:004 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. 04:013:005 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. 04:013:006 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 04:013:007 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. 04:013:008 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun. 04:013:009 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. 04:013:010 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. 04:013:011 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi. 04:013:012 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. 04:013:013 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. 04:013:014 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. 04:013:015 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 04:013:016 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua. 04:013:017 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain: 04:013:018 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; 04:013:019 And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds; 04:013:020 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes. 04:013:021 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath. 04:013:022 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 04:013:023 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs. 04:013:024 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence. 04:013:025 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days. 04:013:026 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land. 04:013:027 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it. 04:013:028 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there. 04:013:029 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan. 04:013:030 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. 04:013:031 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we. 04:013:032 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature. 04:013:033 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight. 04:014:001 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. 04:014:002 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness! 04:014:003 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? 04:014:004 And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. 04:014:005 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. 04:014:006 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 04:014:007 And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land. 04:014:008 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. 04:014:009 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not. 04:014:010 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel. 04:014:011 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them? 04:014:012 I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they. 04:014:013 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) 04:014:014 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night. 04:014:015 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, 04:014:016 Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. 04:014:017 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, 04:014:018 The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation. 04:014:019 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now. 04:014:020 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 04:014:021 But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD. 04:014:022 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 04:014:023 Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: 04:014:024 But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. 04:014:025 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. 04:014:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 04:014:027 How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. 04:014:028 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: 04:014:029 Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me. 04:014:030 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 04:014:031 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised. 04:014:032 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness. 04:014:033 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. 04:014:034 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. 04:014:035 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die. 04:014:036 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land, 04:014:037 Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD. 04:014:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still. 04:014:039 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. 04:014:040 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned. 04:014:041 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper. 04:014:042 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies. 04:014:043 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you. 04:014:044 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. 04:014:045 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah. 04:015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you, 04:015:003 And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a
