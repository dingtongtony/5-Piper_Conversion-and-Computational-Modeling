vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock: 04:015:004 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil. 04:015:005 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb. 04:015:006 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil. 04:015:007 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 04:015:008 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD: 04:015:009 Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil. 04:015:010 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 04:015:011 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid. 04:015:012 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number. 04:015:013 All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 04:015:014 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do. 04:015:015 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD. 04:015:016 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you. 04:015:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:015:018 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you, 04:015:019 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD. 04:015:020 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it. 04:015:021 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations. 04:015:022 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses, 04:015:023 Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations; 04:015:024 Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering. 04:015:025 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance: 04:015:026 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance. 04:015:027 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering. 04:015:028 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him. 04:015:029 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them. 04:015:030 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 04:015:031 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him. 04:015:032 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. 04:015:033 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. 04:015:034 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him. 04:015:035 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. 04:015:036 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses. 04:015:037 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:015:038 Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: 04:015:039 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring: 04:015:040 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. 04:015:041 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God. 04:016:001 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men: 04:016:002 And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown: 04:016:003 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD? 04:016:004 And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face: 04:016:005 And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him. 04:016:006 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 04:016:007 And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi. 04:016:008 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi: 04:016:009 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them? 04:016:010 And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also? 04:016:011 For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him? 04:016:012 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up: 04:016:013 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us? 04:016:014 Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up. 04:016:015 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them. 04:016:016 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow: 04:016:017 And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer. 04:016:018 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron. 04:016:019 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation. 04:016:020 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 04:016:021 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. 04:016:022 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation? 04:016:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:016:024 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. 04:016:025 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. 04:016:026 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest ye be consumed in all their sins. 04:016:027 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children. 04:016:028 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind. 04:016:029 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me. 04:016:030 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD. 04:016:031 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: 04:016:032 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. 04:016:033 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation. 04:016:034 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also. 04:016:035 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense. 04:016:036 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:016:037 Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed. 04:016:038 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel. 04:016:039 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar: 04:016:040 To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses. 04:016:041 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD. 04:016:042 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared. 04:016:043 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation. 04:016:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:016:045 Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces. 04:016:046 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun. 04:016:047 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people. 04:016:048 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. 04:016:049 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah. 04:016:050 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed. 04:017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:017:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod. 04:017:003 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers. 04:017:004 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you. 04:017:005 And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you. 04:017:006 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. 04:017:007 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness. 04:017:008 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds. 04:017:009 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod. 04:017:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not. 04:017:011 And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he. 04:017:012 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish. 04:017:013 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying? 04:018:001 And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. 04:018:002 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness. 04:018:003 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die. 04:018:004 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you. 04:018:005 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel. 04:018:006 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. 04:018:007 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 04:018:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever. 04:018:009 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of their's, every meat offering of their's, and every sin offering of their's, and every trespass offering of their's which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons. 04:018:010 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee. 04:018:011 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it. 04:018:012 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee. 04:018:013 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it. 04:018:014 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine. 04:018:015 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem. 04:018:016 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs. 04:018:017 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 04:018:018 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine. 04:018:019 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee. 04:018:020 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. 04:018:021 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. 04:018:022 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die. 04:018:023 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance. 04:018:024 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. 04:018:025 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:018:026 Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe. 04:018:027 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress. 04:018:028 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron the priest. 04:018:029 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it. 04:018:030 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress. 04:018:031 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation. 04:018:032 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die. 04:019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 04:019:002 This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke: 04:019:003 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face: 04:019:004 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times: 04:019:005 And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn: 04:019:006 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. 04:019:007 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even. 04:019:008 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. 04:019:009 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin. 04:019:010 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever. 04:019:011 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days. 04:019:012 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. 04:019:013 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him. 04:019:014 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. 04:019:015 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean. 04:019:016 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. 04:019:017 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel: 04:019:018 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave: 04:019:019 And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even. 04:019:020 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean. 04:019:021 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even. 04:019:022 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even. 04:020:001 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. 04:020:002 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. 04:020:003 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD! 04:020:004 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there? 04:020:005 And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink. 04:020:006 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them. 04:020:007 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:020:008 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink. 04:020:009 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him. 04:020:010 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock? 04:020:011 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also. 04:020:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. 04:020:013 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them. 04:020:014 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us: 04:020:015 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers: 04:020:016 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: 04:020:017 Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders. 04:020:018 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword. 04:020:019 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet. 04:020:020 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. 04:020:021 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him. 04:020:022 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor. 04:020:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying, 04:020:024 Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah. 04:020:025 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor: 04:020:026 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there. 04:020:027 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. 04:020:028 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. 04:020:029 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel. 04:021:001 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners. 04:021:002 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities. 04:021:003 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah. 04:021:004 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. 04:021:005 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. 04:021:006 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. 04:021:007 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. 04:021:008 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. 04:021:009 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived. 04:021:010 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth. 04:021:011 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising. 04:021:012 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared. 04:021:013 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 04:021:014 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, 04:021:015 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab. 04:021:016 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water. 04:021:017 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it: 04:021:018 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah: 04:021:019 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 04:021:020 And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon. 04:021:021 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, 04:021:022 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way, until we be past thy borders. 04:021:023 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 04:021:024 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. 04:021:025 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof. 04:021:026 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon. 04:021:027 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared: 04:021:028 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon. 04:021:029 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites. 04:021:030 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba. 04:021:031 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 04:021:032 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there. 04:021:033 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei. 04:021:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 04:021:035 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land. 04:022:001 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho. 04:022:002 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 04:022:003 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. 04:022:004 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time. 04:022:005 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me: 04:022:006 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed. 04:022:007 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak. 04:022:008 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. 04:022:009 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee? 04:022:010 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, saying, 04:022:011 Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out. 04:022:012 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed. 04:022:013 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you. 04:022:014 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us. 04:022:015 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they. 04:022:016 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me: 04:022:017 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people. 04:022:018 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more. 04:022:019 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more. 04:022:020 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do. 04:022:021 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. 04:022:022 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him. 04:022:023 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. 04:022:024 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side. 04:022:025 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again. 04:022:026 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. 04:022:027 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff. 04:022:028 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? 04:022:029 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee. 04:022:030 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay. 04:022:031 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face. 04:022:032 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me: 04:022:033 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive. 04:022:034 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again. 04:022:035 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 04:022:036 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast. 04:022:037 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour? 04:022:038 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak. 04:022:039 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth. 04:022:040 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. 04:022:041 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people. 04:023:001 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams. 04:023:002 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram. 04:023:003 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place. 04:023:004 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram. 04:023:005 And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. 04:023:006 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab. 04:023:007 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel. 04:023:008 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied? 04:023:009 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations. 04:023:010 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his! 04:023:011 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether. 04:023:012 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth? 04:023:013 And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence. 04:023:014 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar. 04:023:015 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet the LORD yonder. 04:023:016 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus. 04:023:017 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken? 04:023:018 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: 04:023:019 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? 04:023:020 Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it. 04:023:021 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them. 04:023:022 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn. 04:023:023 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought! 04:023:024 Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the blood of the slain. 04:023:025 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all. 04:023:026 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do? 04:023:027 And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence. 04:023:028 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon. 04:023:029 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. 04:023:030 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar. 04:024:001 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. 04:024:002 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him. 04:024:003 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 04:024:004 He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: 04:024:005 How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel! 04:024:006 As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters. 04:024:007 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted. 04:024:008 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows. 04:024:009 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee. 04:024:010 And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times. 04:024:011 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour. 04:024:012 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying, 04:024:013 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak? 04:024:014 And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days. 04:024:015 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 04:024:016 He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: 04:024:017 I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth. 04:024:018 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly. 04:024:019 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city. 04:024:020 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever. 04:024:021 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock. 04:024:022 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive. 04:024:023 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this! 04:024:024 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever. 04:024:025 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way. 04:025:001 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab. 04:025:002 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. 04:025:003 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel. 04:025:004 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel. 04:025:005 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baalpeor. 04:025:006 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 04:025:007 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand; 04:025:008 And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. 04:025:009 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand. 04:025:010 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:025:011 Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy. 04:025:012 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace: 04:025:013 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel. 04:025:014 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites. 04:025:015 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian. 04:025:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:025:017 Vex the Midianites, and smite them: 04:025:018 For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake. 04:026:001 And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, 04:026:002 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel. 04:026:003 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, 04:026:004 Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt. 04:026:005 Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben; Hanoch, of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu, the family of the Palluites: 04:026:006 Of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites: of Carmi, the family of the Carmites. 04:026:007 These are the families of the Reubenites: and they that were numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and thirty. 04:026:008 And the sons of Pallu; Eliab. 04:026:009 And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This is that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against the LORD: 04:026:010 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign. 04:026:011 Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not. 04:026:012 The sons of Simeon after their families: of Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites: of Jamin, the family of the Jaminites: of Jachin, the family of the Jachinites: 04:026:013 Of Zerah, the family of the Zarhites: of Shaul, the family of the Shaulites. 04:026:014 These are the families of the Simeonites, twenty and two thousand and two hundred. 04:026:015 The children of Gad after their families: of Zephon, the family of the Zephonites: of Haggi, the family of the Haggites: of Shuni, the family of the Shunites: 04:026:016 Of Ozni, the family of the Oznites: of Eri, the family of the Erites: 04:026:017 Of Arod, the family of the Arodites: of Areli, the family of the Arelites. 04:026:018 These are the families of the children of Gad according to those that were numbered of them, forty thousand and five hundred. 04:026:019 The sons of Judah were Er and Onan: and Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. 04:026:020 And the sons of Judah after their families were; of Shelah, the family of the Shelanites: of Pharez, the family of the Pharzites: of Zerah, the family of the Zarhites. 04:026:021 And the sons of Pharez were; of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites: of Hamul, the family of the Hamulites. 04:026:022 These are the families of Judah according to those that were numbered of them, threescore and sixteen thousand and five hundred. 04:026:023 Of the sons of Issachar after their families: of Tola, the family of the Tolaites: of Pua, the family of the Punites: 04:026:024 Of Jashub, the family of the Jashubites: of Shimron, the family of the Shimronites. 04:026:025 These are the families of Issachar according to those that were numbered of them, threescore and four thousand and three hundred. 04:026:026 Of the sons of Zebulun after their families: of Sered, the family of the Sardites: of Elon, the family of the Elonites: of Jahleel, the family of the Jahleelites. 04:026:027 These are the families of the Zebulunites according to those that were numbered of them, threescore thousand and five hundred. 04:026:028 The sons of Joseph after their families were Manasseh and Ephraim. 04:026:029 Of the sons of Manasseh: of Machir, the family of the Machirites: and Machir begat Gilead: of Gilead come the family of the Gileadites. 04:026:030 These are the sons of Gilead: of Jeezer, the family of the Jeezerites: of Helek, the family of the Helekites: 04:026:031 And of Asriel, the family of the Asrielites: and of Shechem, the family of the Shechemites: 04:026:032 And of Shemida, the family of the Shemidaites: and of Hepher, the family of the Hepherites. 04:026:033 And Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons, but daughters: and the names of the daughters of Zelophehad were Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 04:026:034 These are the families of Manasseh, and those that were numbered of them, fifty and two thousand and seven hundred. 04:026:035 These are the sons of Ephraim after their families: of Shuthelah, the family of the Shuthalhites: of Becher, the family of the Bachrites: of Tahan, the family of the Tahanites. 04:026:036 And these are the sons of Shuthelah: of Eran, the family of the Eranites. 04:026:037 These are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those that were numbered of them, thirty and two thousand and five hundred.

And Kohath begat Amram. 04:026:059 And the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt: and she bare unto Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister. 04:026:060 And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 04:026:061 And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before the LORD. 04:026:062 And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel. 04:026:063 These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. 04:026:064 But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. 04:026:065 For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 04:027:001 Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah. 04:027:002 And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 04:027:003 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons. 04:027:004 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father. 04:027:005 And Moses brought their cause before the LORD. 04:027:006 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:027:007 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. 04:027:008 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. 04:027:009 And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. 04:027:010 And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren. 04:027:011 And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses. 04:027:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel. 04:027:013 And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered. 04:027:014 For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. 04:027:015 And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying, 04:027:016 Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, 04:027:017 Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd. 04:027:018 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him; 04:027:019 And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight. 04:027:020 And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. 04:027:021 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation. 04:027:022 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation: 04:027:023 And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses. 04:028:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:028:002 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season. 04:028:003 And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering. 04:028:004 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even; 04:028:005 And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil. 04:028:006 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD. 04:028:007 And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering. 04:028:008 And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 04:028:009 And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof: 04:028:010 This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering. 04:028:011 And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot; 04:028:012 And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram; 04:028:013 And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD. 04:028:014 And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year. 04:028:015 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering. 04:028:016 And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the LORD. 04:028:017 And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten. 04:028:018 In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work therein: 04:028:019 But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish: 04:028:020 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram; 04:028:021 A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs: 04:028:022 And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you. 04:028:023 Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering. 04:028:024 After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering. 04:028:025 And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work. 04:028:026 Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work: 04:028:027 But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD;

ye shall do no servile work: it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you. 04:029:002 And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year without blemish: 04:029:003 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram, 04:029:004 And one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs: 04:029:005 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you: 04:029:006 Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering, and the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering, and their drink offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD. 04:029:007 And ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall not do any work therein: 04:029:008 But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet savour; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the first year; they shall be unto you without blemish: 04:029:009 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals to a bullock, and two tenth deals to one ram, 04:029:010 A several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs: 04:029:011 One kid of the goats for a sin offering;

beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering. 04:029:039 These things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts, beside your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings, and for your meat offerings, and for your drink offerings, and for your peace offerings. 04:029:040 And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD commanded Moses. 04:030:001 And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded. 04:030:002 If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. 04:030:003 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth; 04:030:004 And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. 04:030:005 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her. 04:030:006 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; 04:030:007 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. 04:030:008 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her. 04:030:009 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her. 04:030:010 And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath; 04:030:011 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. 04:030:012 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her. 04:030:013 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. 04:030:014 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them. 04:030:015 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity. 04:030:016 These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house. 04:031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:031:002 Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people. 04:031:003 And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian. 04:031:004 Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war. 04:031:005 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. 04:031:006 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand. 04:031:007 And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males. 04:031:008 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword. 04:031:009 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. 04:031:010 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire. 04:031:011 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts. 04:031:012 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho. 04:031:013 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp. 04:031:014 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle. 04:031:015 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? 04:031:016 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD. 04:031:017 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. 04:031:018 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves. 04:031:019 And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day. 04:031:020 And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood. 04:031:021 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses; 04:031:022 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 04:031:023 Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water. 04:031:024 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp. 04:031:025 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:031:026 Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation: 04:031:027 And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation: 04:031:028 And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep: 04:031:029 Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD. 04:031:030 And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD. 04:031:031 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses. 04:031:032 And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, 04:031:033 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves, 04:031:034 And threescore and one thousand asses, 04:031:035 And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him. 04:031:036 And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep: 04:031:037 And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen. 04:031:038 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was threescore and twelve. 04:031:039 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD's tribute was threescore and one. 04:031:040 And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's tribute was thirty and two persons. 04:031:041 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses. 04:031:042 And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred, 04:031:043 (Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep, 04:031:044 And thirty and six thousand beeves, 04:031:045 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred, 04:031:046 And sixteen thousand persons;) 04:031:047 Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. 04:031:048 And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses: 04:031:049 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us. 04:031:050 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD. 04:031:051 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels. 04:031:052 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. 04:031:053 (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.) 04:031:054 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD. 04:032:001 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle; 04:032:002 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying, 04:032:003 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 04:032:004 Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle: 04:032:005 Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan. 04:032:006 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here? 04:032:007 And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them? 04:032:008 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land. 04:032:009 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them. 04:032:010 And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying, 04:032:011 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me: 04:032:012 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD. 04:032:013 And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed. 04:032:014 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel. 04:032:015 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people. 04:032:016 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones: 04:032:017 But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 04:032:018 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance. 04:032:019 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward. 04:032:020 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war, 04:032:021 And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him, 04:032:022 And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD. 04:032:023 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out. 04:032:024 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth. 04:032:025 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. 04:032:026 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead: 04:032:027 But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the Lord to battle, as my lord saith. 04:032:028 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel: 04:032:029 And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession: 04:032:030 But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan. 04:032:031 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do. 04:032:032 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be our's. 04:032:033 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about. 04:032:034 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, 04:032:035 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah, 04:032:036 And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds
