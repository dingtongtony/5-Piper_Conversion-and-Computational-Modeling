for sheep. 04:032:037 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim, 04:032:038 And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded. 04:032:039 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it. 04:032:040 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein. 04:032:041 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair. 04:032:042 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name. 04:033:001 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron. 04:033:002 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to their goings out. 04:033:003 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians. 04:033:004 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments. 04:033:005 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth. 04:033:006 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness. 04:033:007 And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth, which is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol. 04:033:008 And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah. 04:033:009 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they pitched there. 04:033:010 And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea. 04:033:011 And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin. 04:033:012 And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah. 04:033:013 And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush. 04:033:014 And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink. 04:033:015 And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of Sinai. 04:033:016 And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at Kibrothhattaavah. 04:033:017 And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah, and encamped at Hazeroth. 04:033:018 And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah. 04:033:019 And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez. 04:033:020 And they departed from Rimmonparez, and pitched in Libnah. 04:033:021 And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah. 04:033:022 And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah. 04:033:023 And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher. 04:033:024 And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah. 04:033:025 And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth. 04:033:026 And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath. 04:033:027 And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah. 04:033:028 And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah. 04:033:029 And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah. 04:033:030 And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth. 04:033:031 And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan. 04:033:032 And they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad. 04:033:033 And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah. 04:033:034 And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah. 04:033:035 And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber. 04:033:036 And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh. 04:033:037 And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom. 04:033:038 And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the fifth month. 04:033:039 And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor. 04:033:040 And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel. 04:033:041 And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah. 04:033:042 And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon. 04:033:043 And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth. 04:033:044 And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the border of Moab. 04:033:045 And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad. 04:033:046 And they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in Almondiblathaim. 04:033:047 And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo. 04:033:048 And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. 04:033:049 And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto Abelshittim in the plains of Moab. 04:033:050 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, 04:033:051 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan; 04:033:052 Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places: 04:033:053 And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it. 04:033:054 And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit. 04:033:055 But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. 04:033:056 Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them. 04:034:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:034:002 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:) 04:034:003 Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward: 04:034:004 And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon: 04:034:005 And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea. 04:034:006 And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border. 04:034:007 And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor: 04:034:008 From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad: 04:034:009 And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border. 04:034:010 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham: 04:034:011 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward: 04:034:012 And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about. 04:034:013 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe: 04:034:014 For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance: 04:034:015 The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising. 04:034:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:034:017 These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. 04:034:018 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance. 04:034:019 And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 04:034:020 And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud. 04:034:021 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. 04:034:022 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of Jogli. 04:034:023 The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod. 04:034:024 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan. 04:034:025 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach. 04:034:026 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan. 04:034:027 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi. 04:034:028 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son of Ammihud. 04:034:029 These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan. 04:035:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, 04:035:002 Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them. 04:035:003 And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts. 04:035:004 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about. 04:035:005 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities. 04:035:006 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities. 04:035:007 So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs. 04:035:008 And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth. 04:035:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 04:035:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan; 04:035:011 Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares. 04:035:012 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment. 04:035:013 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge. 04:035:014 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge. 04:035:015 These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither. 04:035:016 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 04:035:017 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 04:035:018 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 04:035:019 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him. 04:035:020 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die; 04:035:021 Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him. 04:035:022 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait, 04:035:023 Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not, and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm: 04:035:024 Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments: 04:035:025 And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil. 04:035:026 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled; 04:035:027 And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood: 04:035:028 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession. 04:035:029 So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 04:035:030 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die. 04:035:031 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death. 04:035:032 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest. 04:035:033 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it. 04:035:034 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel. 04:036:001 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel: 04:036:002 And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters. 04:036:003 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance. 04:036:004 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers. 04:036:005 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well. 04:036:006 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry. 04:036:007 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 04:036:008 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers. 04:036:009 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance. 04:036:010 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad: 04:036:011 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons: 04:036:012 And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. 04:036:013 These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. Book 05 Deuteronomy 05:001:001 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 05:001:002 (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.) 05:001:003 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them; 05:001:004 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: 05:001:005 On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 05:001:006 The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount: 05:001:007 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates. 05:001:008 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them. 05:001:009 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone: 05:001:010 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude. 05:001:011 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!) 05:001:012 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? 05:001:013 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you. 05:001:014 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do. 05:001:015 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes. 05:001:016 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. 05:001:017 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it. 05:001:018 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do. 05:001:019 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea. 05:001:020 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us. 05:001:021 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged. 05:001:022 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come. 05:001:023 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe: 05:001:024 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out. 05:001:025 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us. 05:001:026 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God: 05:001:027 And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. 05:001:028 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there. 05:001:029 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. 05:001:030 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; 05:001:031 And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place. 05:001:032 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, 05:001:033 Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day. 05:001:034 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying, 05:001:035 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers. 05:001:036 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD. 05:001:037 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither. 05:001:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 05:001:039 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. 05:001:040 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. 05:001:041 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill. 05:001:042 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies. 05:001:043 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill. 05:001:044 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah. 05:001:045 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you. 05:001:046 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there. 05:002:001 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days. 05:002:002 And the LORD spake unto me, saying, 05:002:003 Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward. 05:002:004 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore: 05:002:005 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession. 05:002:006 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. 05:002:007 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing. 05:002:008 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. 05:002:009 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession. 05:002:010 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; 05:002:011 Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims. 05:002:012 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them. 05:002:013 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered. 05:002:014 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them. 05:002:015 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed. 05:002:016 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, 05:002:017 That the LORD spake unto me, saying, 05:002:018 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day: 05:002:019 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession. 05:002:020 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; 05:002:021 A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead: 05:002:022 As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day: 05:002:023 And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.) 05:002:024 Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. 05:002:025 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee. 05:002:026 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 05:002:027 Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. 05:002:028 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet; 05:002:029 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us. 05:002:030 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day. 05:002:031 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. 05:002:032 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. 05:002:033 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. 05:002:034 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain: 05:002:035 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took. 05:002:036 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us: 05:002:037 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us. 05:003:001 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 05:003:002 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 05:003:003 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. 05:003:004 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 05:003:005 All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many. 05:003:006 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city. 05:003:007 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. 05:003:008 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon; 05:003:009 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;) 05:003:010 All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 05:003:011 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. 05:003:012 And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. 05:003:013 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. 05:003:014 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day. 05:003:015 And I gave Gilead unto Machir. 05:003:016 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon; 05:003:017 The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward. 05:003:018 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war. 05:003:019 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you; 05:003:020 Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you. 05:003:021 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. 05:003:022 Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you. 05:003:023 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, 05:003:024 O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might? 05:003:025 I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. 05:003:026 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter. 05:003:027 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 05:003:028 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see. 05:003:029 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor. 05:004:001 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you. 05:004:002 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you. 05:004:003 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you. 05:004:004 But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every one of you this day. 05:004:005 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it. 05:004:006 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people. 05:004:007 For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon him for? 05:004:008 And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day? 05:004:009 Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons; 05:004:010 Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children. 05:004:011 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness. 05:004:012 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice. 05:004:013 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. 05:004:014 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it. 05:004:015 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire: 05:004:016 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 05:004:017 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, 05:004:018 The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth: 05:004:019 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven. 05:004:020 But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day. 05:004:021 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance: 05:004:022 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land. 05:004:023 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee. 05:004:024 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God. 05:004:025 When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger: 05:004:026 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed. 05:004:027 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you. 05:004:028 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 05:004:029 But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul. 05:004:030 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice; 05:004:031 (For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them. 05:004:032 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? 05:004:033 Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? 05:004:034 Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? 05:004:035 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him. 05:004:036 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire. 05:004:037 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt; 05:004:038 To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day. 05:004:039 Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else. 05:004:040 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever. 05:004:041 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising; 05:004:042 That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live: 05:004:043 Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites. 05:004:044 And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel: 05:004:045 These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt. 05:004:046 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt: 05:004:047 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising; 05:004:048 From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which is Hermon, 05:004:049 And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah. 05:005:001 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them. 05:005:002 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. 05:005:003 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day. 05:005:004 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire, 05:005:005 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying, 05:005:006 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 05:005:007 Thou shalt have none other gods before me. 05:005:008 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth: 05:005:009 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, 05:005:010 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. 05:005:011 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 05:005:012 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee. 05:005:013 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: 05:005:014 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou. 05:005:015 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day. 05:005:016 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 05:005:017 Thou shalt not kill. 05:005:018 Neither shalt thou commit adultery. 05:005:019 Neither shalt thou steal. 05:005:020 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour. 05:005:021 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is thy neighbour's. 05:005:022 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me. 05:005:023 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 05:005:024 And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth. 05:005:025 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die. 05:005:026 For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? 05:005:027 Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it. 05:005:028 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken. 05:005:029 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever! 05:005:030 Go say to them, Get you into your tents again. 05:005:031 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it. 05:005:032 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. 05:005:033 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess. 05:006:001 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it: 05:006:002 That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged. 05:006:003 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey. 05:006:004 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: 05:006:005 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. 05:006:006 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: 05:006:007 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 05:006:008 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. 05:006:009 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates. 05:006:010 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not, 05:006:011 And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full; 05:006:012 Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 05:006:013 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name. 05:006:014 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which are round about you; 05:006:015 (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth. 05:006:016 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in Massah. 05:006:017 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee. 05:006:018 And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers. 05:006:019 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken. 05:006:020 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you? 05:006:021 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand: 05:006:022 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes: 05:006:023 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers. 05:006:024 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day. 05:006:025 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us. 05:007:001 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou; 05:007:002 And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them: 05:007:003 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. 05:007:004 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly. 05:007:005 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire. 05:007:006 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth. 05:007:007 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: 05:007:008 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 05:007:009 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations; 05:007:010 And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face. 05:007:011 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them. 05:007:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers: 05:007:013 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee. 05:007:014 Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. 05:007:015 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee. 05:007:016 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee. 05:007:017 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them? 05:007:018 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt; 05:007:019 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid. 05:007:020 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed. 05:007:021 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is among you, a mighty God and terrible. 05:007:022 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee. 05:007:023 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed. 05:007:024 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them. 05:007:025 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God. 05:007:026 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing. 05:008:001 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers. 05:008:002 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no. 05:008:003 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. 05:008:004 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years. 05:008:005 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee. 05:008:006 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him. 05:008:007 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; 05:008:008 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; 05:008:009 A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass. 05:008:010 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee. 05:008:011 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day: 05:008:012 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; 05:008:013 And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied; 05:008:014 Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; 05:008:015 Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; 05:008:016 Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end; 05:008:017 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth. 05:008:018 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day. 05:008:019 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. 05:008:020 As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God. 05:009:001 Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven, 05:009:002 A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the children of Anak! 05:009:003 Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee. 05:009:004 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee. 05:009:005 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 05:009:006 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people. 05:009:007 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD. 05:009:008 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you. 05:009:009 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water: 05:009:010 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. 05:009:011 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant. 05:009:012 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image. 05:009:013 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 05:009:014 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they. 05:009:015 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands. 05:009:016 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you. 05:009:017 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes. 05:009:018 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. 05:009:019 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also. 05:009:020 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. 05:009:021 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount. 05:009:022 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath. 05:009:023 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice. 05:009:024 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you. 05:009:025 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he would destroy you. 05:009:026 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 05:009:027 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin: 05:009:028 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness. 05:009:029 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm. 05:010:001 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood. 05:010:002 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. 05:010:003 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand. 05:010:004 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me. 05:010:005 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me. 05:010:006 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead. 05:010:007 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters. 05:010:008 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day. 05:010:009 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him. 05:010:010 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee. 05:010:011 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them. 05:010:012 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, 05:010:013 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good? 05:010:014 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy God, the earth also, with all that therein is. 05:010:015 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day. 05:010:016 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked. 05:010:017 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward: 05:010:018 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. 05:010:019 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 05:010:020 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name. 05:010:021 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen. 05:010:022 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude. 05:011:001 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway. 05:011:002 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm, 05:011:003 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; 05:011:004 And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day; 05:011:005 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place; 05:011:006 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all Israel: 05:011:007 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did. 05:011:008 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it; 05:011:009 And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 05:011:010 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: 05:011:011 But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven: 05:011:012 A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year. 05:011:013 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, 05:011:014 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. 05:011:015 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full. 05:011:016 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 05:011:017 And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you. 05:011:018 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. 05:011:019 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 05:011:020 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates: 05:011:021 That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth. 05:011:022 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him; 05:011:023 Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves. 05:011:024 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be. 05:011:025 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you. 05:011:026 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; 05:011:027 A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day: 05:011:028 And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known. 05:011:029 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal. 05:011:030 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh? 05:011:031 For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein. 05:011:032 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day. 05:012:001 These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth. 05:012:002 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree: 05:012:003 And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place. 05:012:004 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God. 05:012:005 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come: 05:012:006 And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks: 05:012:007 And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee. 05:012:008 Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes. 05:012:009 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you. 05:012:010 But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; 05:012:011 Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD: 05:012:012 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you. 05:012:013 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest: 05:012:014 But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee. 05:012:015 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart. 05:012:016 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water. 05:012:017 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand: 05:012:018 But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto. 05:012:019 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth. 05:012:020 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after. 05:012:021 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after. 05:012:022 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike. 05:012:023 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh. 05:012:024 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water. 05:012:025 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD. 05:012:026 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose: 05:012:027 And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh. 05:012:028 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God. 05:012:029 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land; 05:012:030 Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise. 05:012:031 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods. 05:012:032 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it. 05:013:001 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, 05:013:002 And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; 05:013:003 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul. 05:013:004 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him. 05:013:005 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee. 05:013:006 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; 05:013:007 Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; 05:013:008 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: 05:013:009 But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. 05:013:010 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 05:013:011 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you. 05:013:012 If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying, 05:013:013 Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known; 05:013:014 Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you; 05:013:015 Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword. 05:013:016 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again. 05:013:017 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers; 05:013:018 When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God. 05:014:001 Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead. 05:014:002 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations that are upon the earth. 05:014:003 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing. 05:014:004 These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat, 05:014:005 The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois. 05:014:006 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat. 05:014:007 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you. 05:014:008 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase. 05:014:009 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat: 05:014:010 And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you. 05:014:011 Of all clean birds ye shall eat. 05:014:012 But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, 05:014:013 And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind, 05:014:014 And every raven after his kind, 05:014:015 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind, 05:014:016 The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, 05:014:017 And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant, 05:014:018 And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. 05:014:019 And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they shall not be eaten. 05:014:020 But of all clean fowls ye may eat. 05:014:021 Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. 05:014:022 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field bringeth forth year by year. 05:014:023 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always. 05:014:024 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee: 05:014:025 Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: 05:014:026 And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household, 05:014:027 And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee. 05:014:028 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within thy gates: 05:014:029 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest. 05:015:001 At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release. 05:015:002 And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD's release. 05:015:003 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release; 05:015:004 Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it: 05:015:005 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day. 05:015:006 For the LORD thy
